# HALOGRIP Portfolio — Change Log

Detailed session-by-session history for this project (what changed, why, how it was
verified), moved out of `CLAUDE.md` to keep the auto-loaded project instructions lean.
This file is **not** auto-loaded into context — read it only when you need the historical
rationale behind an existing decision. New entries go here, not in `CLAUDE.md`.

### Post Harvest 04, and a diagram legibility floor that was silently broken everywhere (this session)

**Section 04 was four bands on four different grids.** Sylvia: "感觉这个section 4 的排版信息不是
很集中，这次的plan有改进这个排版的计划吗" — and the plan did not: it listed only "add the chapter
label, emphasise the latent-need bubbles" for 04. Measured, the section ran 1368 / 651+651 indented
20px / 1040 / 793+529, so nothing but x=0 was shared and one band sat 20px in from every other.
Worse, the PICS-bag argument was split in half: the two paragraphs explaining why the farmers had
stopped trusting the bags sat *below* the needs map, separated from the bag photo by the largest
figure in the section.

Rebuilt as three beats on one axis, moving copy rather than rewriting it:
1. **The brief** — `.ph-bags` now carries the label, the bag text and both stranded paragraphs
   beside the photo. The blue accent moved from a left border to a top rule, which is what removes
   the 20px indent while keeping the colour.
2. **The finding** — the needs map alone, full canvas width, nothing competing.
3. **The redirect** — the maize year, full canvas width.

All four blocks now measure L56 / R56 / w1368, with even 55px gaps.

**The bigger find: `max-height` was making every diagram smaller, not smaller-boxed.**
`.ph-v2 .ph-svg-body svg { max-height: 64vh }` does not shrink a replaced element with a viewBox
— the drawing letterboxes inside the capped box. So a tall diagram rendered *smaller* while still
occupying the full height, with dead margins either side. Measured on the needs map: a 1326px box
containing a drawing scaled to 0.639, its in-bubble labels at **6.1px**, with ~340px of empty space
on each flank. The 09 checklist was doing the same at 0.895 instead of 1.124. This is very likely
the source of the "好多奇怪的留白" reported in earlier passes. SVGs are now excluded from the cap;
width alone bounds them. Every drawing measures `slack=0` afterwards.

**The 12px floor did not hold below 1536px.** The per-drawing minimum widths lived inside
`@media (max-width: 767px)`, so between 768px and the design width there was no floor at all —
measured at 1024px, five of seven drawings rendered their smallest labels at 8.1–11.2px. Four of
the six selectors in that block (`.ph-needs`, `.ph-timeline`, `.ph-cycle`, `.ph-locator`) also
matched nothing and never had. Rewritten onto the classes actually in use, unconditional, each
value derived as `12px ÷ smallest declared label × viewBox width`.

That change then exposed a second bug: a child `min-width` against a grid item's default
`min-width: auto` pushed the box wider than the screen instead of scrolling inside it — at 430px
the 03 timeline box was 780px and the 05 checklist 820px. Fixed with `min-width: 0; max-width: 100%`
on `.ph-svg`.

**Drawings re-typeset** so their smallest label clears 12px at the width they are actually shown:
`sketch-legend` redrawn from an 800×66 strip (squeezed into a 420px flex slot, rendering 5.8px)
to 600×76 at scale 1.0; `field-timeline` re-spaced and enlarged; `seme-locator`, `maize-lifecycle`
and both requirement checklists rescaled. `needs-map` was left alone on purpose — its 9.5px labels
are inside bubbles and already hand-hyphenated (`transport-/ation`, `INDEPEN-/DENCE`), so enlarging
them would overflow the circles; widening the figure to the full canvas lifted them to 12.6px
instead. The 09 checklist also had a pre-existing collision (`NOT EVALUATED` overlapping the longest
row by 22px at its old size); its viewBox widened 888 → 960 to give the status tags their own gutter.

**`inline-svg.tsx` now only caches in production.** The module-level `Map` survived file edits for
the life of the dev server, so SVG changes did not appear until the module happened to recompile.

**Verified.** `tsc --noEmit` clean. At 1536/1024/768/430: every drawing ≥12px, no DOM text under
12px, no overflow or collisions inside any drawing, and the page never scrolls sideways at any width
(only the diagram boxes do). Fail-open: server HTML carries 32 `ph-reveal` and zero `ph-reveal-armed`
/ `is-visible` with no inline `opacity: 0`; from a top-of-page load all 32 arm, nothing is hidden
above the fold at first paint, and a single jump to the bottom leaves nothing hidden. With
`IntersectionObserver` stubbed to a no-op, all 32 blocks still resolved via the 1200ms failsafe.
Anchor landings on `#status`, `#reflection` and `#final-concept` show their targets immediately.
Headings: only 07 and 09 wrap to two lines now, 09 down from three.

**One incident worth recording.** A `String.indexOf` anchor in a scripted edit returned `-1`, so a
`slice(start, -1)` swallowed sections 05–10 of `page.tsx` (975 lines → 373). Recovered by pulling
the complete pre-truncation source out of a Next dev sourcemap
(`.next/dev/server/chunks/ssr/[root-of-the-server]__*.js.map`, `sections[].map.sourcesContent`),
splicing the tail back on and re-applying the chapter-label and stagger edits. Guard every scripted
replacement with an occurrence count before writing.

### Post Harvest 02 locator: two separated panels, and the county was wrong (this session, follow-up)
- Sylvia: "Remove the diagonal connector line completely—it looks like an accidental construction
  line and does not communicate zooming. Rebuild the locator as two clearly separated sequential
  panels [...] Connect the panels only with a small downward arrow or the words 'ZOOM IN'. Do not
  overlap the maps and do not use cartographic projection lines. The reading order must be obvious
  without the caption. Also verify whether the field site belongs to Kisumu County or Siaya County
  before finalising the labels."
- **The projection cone is gone.** The inset-plus-cone from the previous pass is replaced by two
  framed panels, stacked, fully separated, sharing no edge: `01 / WESTERN KENYA` (a small centred
  panel holding the whole country with the study region boxed in deep blue) and
  `02 / SEME — FIELD SITE` (the full-width local map). The only mark crossing between them is a
  centred "ZOOM IN" arrow standing in the gap, touching neither frame. Reading order now comes from
  the numbered titles, not from geometry the reader has to decode.
- **The field site is in KISUMU County, not Siaya — the booklet header is wrong.** Verified two
  ways before the labels were finalised: (1) grid-sampling ~24,600 points inside the geoBoundaries
  ADM2 "Seme" polygon and testing each against all 47 ADM1 counties puts **99.7% of its area in
  Kisumu** (0.3% Siaya, 0.1% Vihiga — boundary-sampling noise); (2) Seme is one of Kisumu County's
  seven constituencies, created in 2012, 268 sq km, pop. 121,667 — and 121,667/268 = 454, which is
  exactly the "about 450 per square kilometre" already in `content.ts`. Siaya is the county
  immediately west; the marker sits just across its boundary, which is why the earlier draft looked
  odd with Siaya highlighted.
  - Panel 02 now highlights and labels **KISUMU COUNTY**, and two strings in `content.ts` were
    corrected: `context.dateline` ("Seme, Siaya County" -> "Seme, Kisumu County") and
    `context.captions.locator`, which now also names Siaya as the neighbour so the booklet's own
    wording still makes sense to anyone comparing the two. **Sylvia should confirm** — she was
    there, and if the booklet's "Siaya" was deliberate (an older boundary, or a partner
    organisation's framing) this is a one-line revert.
- Other fixes in the same pass: Lake Victoria is clipped to Kenya in panel 01, so the Ugandan and
  Tanzanian two thirds of the lake no longer trail off the country's west side as an unexplained
  blob; the county label anchor is chosen by testing the label's *whole width* for "inside Kisumu
  and clear of the lake" rather than by centroid, which had it straddling the shoreline; panel 01's
  ground uses the same "outside Kenya" tone as panel 02, so the two panels read as one system.
- Verified with `sharp` renders at review size and at the real 340px `.ph-v2-map` width (the
  reading order and every label survive the small size), and with `npm run build`.

### Post Harvest 02 locator map redrawn from real geodata as a two-level locator (this session, follow-up)
- Sylvia, after the colour fix below: "Redesign the Section 02 map as a clear locator graphic, not
  an extracted booklet diagram. The current image begins at an unfamiliar local scale, so readers
  cannot identify Kenya, distinguish land from water, or understand the relationship between Siaya
  County and Seme. [...] The map should communicate 'western Kenya, near Lake Victoria' within two
  seconds. Do not enlarge the current map. Redraw and simplify its information hierarchy."
- **The traced coastline is gone.** `public/post-harvest/diagram/seme-locator.svg` is now
  *generated* by `scripts/build-seme-locator.mjs` from open geodata, so it is checkable and
  re-runnable instead of being an eyeballed trace:
  - Natural Earth 1:50m countries (public domain) — the Kenya silhouette in the inset,
  - Natural Earth 1:10m lakes (public domain) — Lake Victoria's real shoreline,
  - geoBoundaries gbOpen KEN ADM1 + ADM2 (public domain, RCMRD) — Siaya County, and the Seme
    polygon whose centroid places the marker.
  The script fetches once into `scripts/.cache/` (gitignored, ~9MB) and is the only thing that
  should ever edit that SVG — hand-editing it will be overwritten on the next run.
- **Two-level composition.** A small whole-of-Kenya inset at the top, the study region boxed in
  deep blue, opening downward through a pale projection cone into the detail frame: Lake Victoria,
  Siaya County, Seme. The reader starts from a country shape they can recognise, not from an
  unlabelled shoreline. Header reads "Western Kenya / LAKE VICTORIA BASIN" so the two-second
  message is carried by type as well as by geometry.
- **Colour does one job each.** Deep blue `#17357a` is used *only* for the Seme marker, its label,
  and the inset box + cone. Land is warm-neutral grey (`#e8e6e0` inside Kenya, `#f5f4f2` outside,
  so the national border reads without being drawn or labelled), Siaya is one step darker
  (`#dbd9d4`), and water is `#b9c4d2` — cooler *and* darker than every land tone, which is the
  thing the previous version got backwards.
- **Everything too small to read was cut.** "Winam Gulf", "Homa Bay" and the county dot are gone;
  four labels remain (KENYA / Western Kenya / SIAYA COUNTY / Lake Victoria) plus "SEME — FIELD
  SITE". Label positions are computed, not hand-placed: Siaya's is set from the county's
  area-weighted centroid lifted into its northern half (its true centroid sits at almost exactly
  Seme's latitude and would have collided with the marker), and the local extent is deliberately
  off-centre east so the Seme label has room to run without being clipped.
- **Two implementation notes.** (1) Kenya's landmass in the detail frame is the union of the 47
  county polygons, not the 1:50m national outline — at this scale the coarse national polygon
  leaves visible slivers of "not Kenya" along the lake shore; the counties are filled and never
  stroked, plus a 2-unit stroke in the fill colour to close antialiasing seams between neighbours.
  (2) `inline-svg.tsx` injects this file into the page's HTML, so off-screen geometry is pure page
  weight: every ring is Sutherland-Hodgman clipped to the extent before simplification, which took
  the output from 107KB to 18KB with no visible change.
- **One thing to check, not a bug in the drawing.** geoBoundaries puts the Seme sub-county polygon
  inside **Kisumu County**, not Siaya — its centroid (34.532, -0.071) resolves to Kisumu, and Seme
  is one of Kisumu's sub-counties alongside Kisumu East/West/Central, Muhoroni, Nyando and Nyakach.
  The marker is drawn at its true position, which puts it just across Siaya's eastern boundary. The
  site copy still says Siaya in three places (`content.ts`: `dateline`, `captions.locator`, and the
  booklet's own page header). Left alone pending Sylvia's call — she was there and the booklet may
  be using an older or informal boundary.
- Verified by rasterising the SVG with the project's own `sharp` at both review size and the real
  340px `.ph-v2-map` display width, and with `npm run build`.

### Post Harvest 02 locator map — water/land figure-ground inverted, so the lake read as a landmass (this session)
- Sylvia: "这个图片是你做的吗，感觉湖水的部分太像陆地。让人看不懂"
- She was right, and it was my drawing. `public/post-harvest/diagram/seme-locator.svg` (the
  `.ph-v2-map` inline SVG in section 02) traces the Kenyan shore of Lake Victoria, and the single
  filled path in it **is the water** — but it was filled `#e6ebf4` on a `#fbfbfa` background. Two
  near-whites separated by one crisp outline: the eye takes the outlined shape as the figure and
  the empty ground as background, i.e. exactly backwards. It looked like a country sitting on
  blank paper.
- **Fix is colour, not geometry** — the traced coastline `d` is untouched, so nothing about the
  map's accuracy or the Seme pin position moved:
  - background rect (the land) `#fbfbfa` -> `#f2f2f0` (the existing `--paper-sunk` value, so the
    land stays on-palette — deliberately *not* a cartographic tan, per the palette note at the top
    of `post-harvest.css`),
  - water fill `#e6ebf4` -> `#a9c8e8`, coastline stroke `#9fb2d0` -> `#5f87b6`,
  - hydronyms (Lake Victoria / Winam Gulf / Homa Bay) set in italic — the standard cartographic
    signal for water — and darkened from `#9fb2d0` to `#375c8c` so they stay legible on the
    stronger blue instead of dissolving into it.
- **Two smaller corrections in the same pass.** "Home Bay" -> "Homa Bay" (misspelled). And the grey
  dot next to "Siaya County" was removed: with no county boundary drawn anywhere on the map it
  pointed at nothing, and read as a second location pin competing with Seme. It is now an
  unadorned letterspaced area label, which is what it always actually was. `aria-label` updated to
  say which tone is water and which is land.
- Verified by rasterizing the SVG with the project's own `sharp` at 120 DPI and comparing before
  and after.

### Post Harvest 07 — the intro composition refined, previews left untouched (this session, follow-up)
- Sylvia: the handbook preview structure now works; keep the "Inside the handbook / Browse all 53
  pages ->" row and the two equal spreads exactly as they are. Refine only the introductory
  composition above it: rename the title to "The Drying Tower Handbook" so the completed
  deliverable is immediately clear; move "FINAL CONCEPT" above the title as an eyebrow, not
  underneath; grow the cover about 30%; narrow the spec column and its divider lines, which
  currently overwhelm the cover; compress the top composition vertically by about 100-140px so the
  previews appear sooner; increase the contrast of captions and body copy on the blue background;
  keep the 53-page link secondary and in its current position; do not redesign the previews again.
- **Heading and eyebrow.** `finalConcept.heading` renamed "The Drying Tower" -> "The Drying Tower
  Handbook" in content.ts (the concept keeps its own name, "The Drying Tower," everywhere else in
  the section's body copy — only the heading changed, per the request). The eyebrow ("Final
  Concept") moved out of `.lede` (where it rendered below the heading, inside the shared
  `.ph-v2-head` grid every other section also uses) to a plain sibling `<p className="ph-lbl
  ph-07-eyebrow">` rendered before `.ph-v2-head` — section 07's own markup only, so the eight other
  sections that still put their label inside `.lede` are untouched.
- **Cover +30%, spec column narrower — one change, not two.** `.ph-07-ident`'s cap went 300px ->
  390px (exactly the requested 30%). Rather than relying on that cap alone against a wide grid
  track, the row's ratio also moved from 3.4fr/8.6fr to 4.4fr/7.6fr (the same split already used by
  `.ph-06-lead`, so it is not a new number invented for this one spot) — this makes the 390px cap
  the reliably binding constraint across ordinary viewport widths, and shrinks the aside/spec
  column's track from ~943px to ~833px, along with every divider line inside it (`.ph-annot`'s
  `border-top` runs the column's full width). Verified the aside's rendered height is unaffected by
  its own narrower track: its content (a lead paragraph and three short annotation rows) is already
  width-capped by `--measure` well inside both the old and new track widths, so nothing re-wraps.
- **100-140px turned out to need two passes, because the first pass was calibrated against the
  wrong viewport.** Compressed five things: the section's top padding (split off from the shared
  `padding-block` so only the top moved, not the section's closing rhythm), `.ph-07-lead`'s
  margin-top, `.ph-07-inside`'s margin-top, the annotation list's row gap, and its inline top
  margin. A first pass, measured live via a Chrome-bridge session whose reported `innerWidth`
  turned out to be stale (2304px reported, 1536px actual — the same window-sizing flakiness noted
  in the last two entries), read back a 105-107px delta and looked done. Re-measured with
  `innerWidth`/`innerHeight` cross-checked in the same call as the delta (confirmed 1536x639, the
  viewport this session's own screenshots have used throughout): the real delta was only 69px.
  Tightened all five clamp ranges further and re-verified in the same confirmed viewport: 102px.
  Method note for next time: when this bridge's window sizing has already misbehaved once in a
  session, distrust its `innerWidth` on later calls too until it's re-confirmed in the same
  execution as whatever is being measured, not assumed from an earlier resize call.
- **Contrast was not re-touched.** `--on-blue-dim` was already bumped 0.62 -> 0.82 alpha in the
  entry two below this one; re-verified live it still reads 0.82 on `.ph-cap` inside this section,
  so the request was already satisfied and needed no further change here.
- **The previews group is untouched, verified rather than assumed:** `.ph-07-inside`,
  `.ph-07-inside-head`, `.ph-07-previews` and their children were not edited in this pass, and the
  link's position (in the header row, opposite the "Inside the handbook" label) did not move.
- Verified with `npx next build` (clean) and, live, in the confirmed 1536x639 viewport: eyebrow
  renders above the heading (`getBoundingClientRect().top` compared), heading text reads "The
  Drying Tower Handbook", cover renders at 390px, aside column at 833px, the intro-to-previews gap
  measures 102px against a 69px baseline (both from the same script, same viewport), and the full
  reader still opens on 01/07, crosses the tier to 08/53, and preserves scroll position (delta 0)
  through Escape.

### Post Harvest 07 — the boxed button folded into the previews' own header row (this session, follow-up)
- Sylvia, on the boxed secondary button from the previous entry below: it is no longer too small,
  but it floats alone in a large empty area, detached from both the previews and the conclusion,
  and creates an unnecessary third composition. Remove the standalone CTA. Integrate the entry into
  a header over the two previews ("INSIDE THE HANDBOOK" left, "Browse all 53 pages ->" right, a rule
  beneath), previews directly below it. Style the link as a plain secondary text button, ~15-16px
  semibold, hover underline or colour change, one line, not placed inside either image. After the
  captions, 64-80px before the concluding statement, quote and status text aligned at the same top,
  remove the large empty gap. Increase the contrast of the grey-blue captions and body text on the
  navy background. Preserve the 53-page reader and its functionality.
- **Third shape for this control in two sessions, and the previous entry's own reasoning explains
  why it kept moving.** A full-width "paper on blue" band solved "four entrances, none primary" but
  became the section's dominant element once the reader was reclassified as optional. A small
  bordered box fixed the size but had nowhere to belong — it was not part of the previews, not part
  of the conclusion, just adrift between them. It is now `.ph-hb-textlink`: no box, sized to its own
  label, living inside `.ph-07-inside-head` beside the label "Inside the handbook" (new copy,
  `finalConcept.previewsLabel`) so "optional access" reads as one property of the previews group
  rather than a destination in its own right. `HandbookOpen`'s props collapsed from `{title, sub}`
  to a single `{label}` to match — one line only, per the request, not the two-line copy from
  the box version.
- **The 64-80px gap and the top-alignment were the same root cause: `.ph-07-close`'s two children
  had inconsistent spacing baked in.** \`.ph-status-line\` carried its own \`margin-top: var(--block-y)\`
  (up to 60px) plus a \`border-top\` and \`padding-top\`, meant for contexts where it stands alone; paired
  against \`.ph-handbook-quote\` (plain, no top offset) in a two-column grid with \`align-items: start\`,
  that extra box-model pushed the status text below the quote's top edge despite the grid aligning
  both columns to the same start line. Zeroed all three properties in the \`.ph-07-close\` scope.
  Separately, \`.ph-07-close\`'s own \`margin-top\` was the generic \`--beat-y\` token (which the removed
  CTA had *also* carried on top of, stacking two beats of near-empty canvas around a small button);
  replaced with an explicit \`clamp(64px, 6vw, 80px)\` matching the literal ask. Verified live: quote
  and status \`getBoundingClientRect().top\` both read 345px (delta 0), gap from the previews' bottom
  edge to \`.ph-07-close\`'s top measured 80px.
- **Contrast: one token, \`--on-blue-dim\`, from 0.62 to 0.82 alpha.** It is the sole color behind
  every caption, body paragraph, annotation label and the handbook quote's attribution on the
  section's navy field (\`.ph-v2-blue .ph-cap\`, \`.ph-body\`, \`.ph-annot .k\`, \`.ph-status-line span\`,
  etc.) — bumping it fixed all of them from one place rather than hunting each rule down. Computed
  against \`--blue\` (#17357a): 0.62 alpha blended to roughly 5:1, past the WCAG AA floor (4.5:1) on
  paper but reading as flat grey-on-navy in the screenshot Sylvia was looking at; 0.82 blends to
  roughly 7.6:1, near AAA, while staying visibly dimmer than full \`--on-blue\` (headings, emphasis)
  so the two-tier hierarchy is still legible. \`--on-blue-line\` (borders, 0.28 alpha) was left alone —
  the request was about text, not rules.
- Preview images were already non-clickable (confirmed again, zero clickable elements inside
  \`.ph-07-previews\`) and the reader's scroll-preservation fix (\`{ preventScroll: true }\` on the
  returned focus, from the previous entry) needed no change — verified again with the new trigger
  element: scrollY delta 0 across both close paths (the Close button, Escape) with the link as the
  origin instead of the removed box.
- Verified with \`npx next build\` (clean) and, live: the header row renders exactly as requested
  (label left, link right, rule beneath, previews directly under it); the link is 15px/600, single
  line "Browse all 53 pages ->", \`cursor: pointer\`, underlines on hover (zoomed screenshot); clicking
  it opens the reader on 01/07 and the full 53-page walk (end of overview -> cross the tier -> End)
  reproduces the same counts as every previous pass; the old \`.ph-hb-secondary\` class matches zero
  elements anywhere in the section.

### Post Harvest 07 — the entrance to the reader demoted from a dominant band to a secondary button (this session)
- Sylvia: the 53-page reader is an optional deep dive, not the primary reading path, and opening it
  interrupts the case-study flow — so the entry should be clear but visually secondary. Keep the two
  large interior previews. Replace the image-embedded entrances (there were none left to embed by
  this point; read as confirming the full-width band from the previous session had also become too
  dominant) with one secondary outline button: "Browse the full handbook" / "53 pages · Opens in
  full-screen reader ->", placed beneath the previews, 14-16px label, ~44-48px control height,
  clearly bordered, pointer cursor, obvious hover, opens the reader at the cover. Do not make the
  preview images clickable. Preserve scroll position on close. Hierarchy: (1) handbook as final
  deliverable, (2) two representative previews, (3) optional access to all 53 pages.
- **The full-width "paper on blue" band from the previous session was itself the problem now.** It
  was built to solve "the page has four entrances and none look primary" — correct at the time — but
  at full canvas width with a 21-32px serif title it became the section's dominant element, which is
  wrong once the reader is reclassified as optional rather than the natural next step. Demoted to
  \`.ph-hb-secondary\`: sized to its own content (\`inline-flex\`, not \`width: 100%\`), outline instead
  of a solid fill, sans-serif label at 15px/13px instead of a 21-32px serif headline, hover firms the
  border and adds a faint tint instead of inverting paper-to-ink. Measured live at 290 x 47px, inside
  the requested ~44-48px band.
- **The arrow moved from the title to the subtitle**, because the requested copy puts it there
  ("... Opens in full-screen reader ->") rather than after the title as the previous band did. Copy
  stays in \`finalConcept.handbookCta\` (content.ts), page count still interpolated from
  \`HANDBOOK_TOTAL\` so the button's promise cannot drift from the reader's actual page count.
- **Scroll preservation: one line, \`{ preventScroll: true }\` on the returned focus.** The button
  sits mid-page, under the two previews, so a plain \`.focus()\` on close scrolls the trigger into view
  if the browser considers it not fully visible — the classic modal-close scroll-jump. Nothing else
  needed fixing: the overlay is \`position: fixed\` and \`overflow: hidden\` on body only blocks
  scrolling, it does not move the stored offset, so the underlying page never actually scrolled while
  the reader was open. Verified live, scrollY before vs. after across all three close paths (Escape,
  the Close button, a backdrop click): delta 0 in every case.
- Preview images were already non-clickable plain \`<Image>\`s from the previous session (that
  session's own "one entrance" pass had already pulled the pills off the spreads and onto the band) —
  confirmed live rather than assumed: zero clickable elements inside \`.ph-07-previews\`.
- Verified with \`npx next build\` (clean) and, live: the button's rect (290 x 47px), its two-line
  text matches the requested copy exactly, \`cursor: pointer\`, the hover tint is visible on a zoomed
  screenshot, clicking it opens the reader on 01/07, and the full 53-page walk (open -> end of
  overview -> cross the tier -> End -> Home -> Escape) reproduces the same counts and disabled states
  as every previous pass.

### Post Harvest 07 — previewing and reading split into separate affordances (this session)
- Sylvia, after the reader shipped: keep two large interior previews (one construction-step spread,
  one materials/cut-list spread) side by side at equal weight, capped near 55-60vh, with short
  captions; strip the small buttons out of the images and give each preview no reader entrance of
  its own; add one unmistakable full-width CTA ("OPEN THE COMPLETE HANDBOOK ->" / "Browse all 53
  pages . Jump between chapters . Full-screen reader"), the whole band clickable with a clear
  border or paper background, pointer cursor and an obvious hover state, opening the reader at the
  cover; keep the cover itself as a smaller publication identifier near the intro; preserve the
  53-page reader exactly.
- **The section now says three things, each with exactly one job.** The cover (small, beside the
  intro copy) says what the publication IS. The two interior spreads (large, equal columns) say
  what is INSIDE it — a construction step and the Drying Tower cut list, chosen because they show
  actual content rather than the cover, which shows nothing about the interior. The CTA band is the
  only thing that OPENS anything. Previously every one of the three plates carried its own pill, so
  the page had four entrances and none of them read as the main one.
- `HandbookPlate` (a sheet plus an absolutely-positioned button pill) is gone from
  handbook-reader.tsx. In its place, `HandbookOpen` renders one `<button>` end to end — title,
  arrow and subtitle all inside the hit area, not a link with a separate clickable region inside
  it. It calls the same `openHandbook()` bus the old pills used, landing on `HANDBOOK_PLATE_PAGE
  .cover`, so the reader itself did not change at all.
- **Copy lives in content.ts, not hand-typed in the CTA.** `finalConcept.handbookCta` builds its
  subtitle from `HANDBOOK_TOTAL` (imported from handbook-pages.ts) rather than a literal "53", so
  the promise on the button cannot drift from the reader's actual page count if pages are ever
  added or removed.
- **The cover shrunk from the section's dominant to an identifier.** `.ph-07-lead" flipped from a
  7fr/5fr split (cover leading) to 3.4fr/8.6fr (copy leading, cover capped at 300px) because it is
  no longer the way in — it does not need the visual weight that implied.
- **The 55-60vh cap on the previews had to be spelled as a width, not a height, or it deadlocks.**
  The obvious rule, `width: auto; max-height: 58vh`, means the image has 0x0 intrinsic size before
  it loads, so the grid row it sits in collapses to 0px, so the image never scrolls into view, so
  `next/image`'s lazy loading never fires and it never loads at all — confirmed live, both preview
  images stuck at `naturalWidth/Height: 0` and the wrapping grid measured 86px tall instead of
  roughly 350-400px. Fixed by keeping `width: 100%` (so next/image can reserve the box from the
  width/height attributes it already emits) and capping the wrapper's `max-width` at
  `calc(58vh * 1.42)`, the scans' own aspect ratio, which bounds the height without a
  `max-height` anywhere. Verified after the fix: both images loaded (706x490 and 706x499 natural)
  at 342-349px tall in a 639px-tall viewport, about 54-55vh.
- Verified with `npx next build` (clean, twice — once before finding the deadlock, once after)
  and, live: both preview images decode and size correctly; the CTA band is a `<button>` with
  `cursor: pointer`, inverts paper-to-ink on hover, and opens the reader on 01/07; the full
  53-page walk (band -> end of overview -> cross the tier -> End -> Home -> Escape) reproduces the
  same counts and disabled states as the previous session's pass; zero elements matching the old
  `.ph-hb-plate`, `.ph-hb-open` or `.ph-hb-cta` classes remain anywhere in the section.
- Not verified by eye: a narrow-viewport screenshot. The browser bridge's window resize did not
  take effect this session (still reported 1536x639 after a resize call asked for 390x844) — the
  same flakiness noted in the previous entry. Did not fight it a second time; instead confirmed the
  mobile rule directly in the stylesheet (`.ph-07-previews` is mobile-first `1fr`, only becoming
  `1fr 1fr` at `min-width: 900px`, and `.ph-hb-band` is unconditionally `width: 100%`), which is
  the same code path the verified desktop screenshot already exercised. **Worth one human look on
  an actual narrow window.**

### Post Harvest 07 — the construction handbook is readable end to end, not three plates of it (this session)
- Sylvia: "你说能把那个handbook变成就是可翻阅的，会不会花很多token" then "好，就放section07", and on scope,
  "分两层".
- **Corrected mid-task: the handbook is 53 sheets, not 7.** The first estimate came off the seven
  probe renders already sitting in `scratch/handbook-probe/` (p054-p060), which were only the
  slice a previous session cut the cover and cut-list plates from. Scanned the report PDF page by
  page instead: the handbook is the final appendix, PDF p.54 to p.106, and it does not stop at the
  cut lists. Chapter starts were read off the section title pages that still carry live text —
  "Black Box" (p.61), "Drying Tower" (p.76), "Metal shelves" (p.102), "How to use" (p.104).
- **Rendering: a mode, not 53 JOBS rows.** `scripts/convert-pdf-pages.mjs --handbook` renders
  p.54-106 to `public/post-harvest/handbook/pages/handbook-NN-{1600,900}.webp`, numbered by the
  handbook's own 1-based count. 106 files, 6.4 MB, all 53 pages uniform at 842 x 595 pt. Verified
  live: every one of the 106 files returns 200.
- **Two tiers, per Sylvia.** The reader opens on the 7-page overview (cover, what it is, the
  principle, tools, raw materials, both cut lists). "View all 53 pages" reveals the 46 assembly
  sheets, and Next on sheet 07 does the same thing rather than dead-ending on a disabled button.
  Opening on a plate past the overview (the Step 1 spread is sheet 24) implies the full set.
- **Section 07's three plates are unchanged as pictures; each is now an entry point.** Which sheet
  each one shows was matched against the rendered sequence pixel by pixel rather than guessed:
  cover -> 01, tools -> 04 and cut list -> 07 are exact, and the two plates cropped for the page
  (`handbook-step`, `handbook-howto`, both 1.440 against the sheets' 1.413) matched 24 and 52.
- **The overlay is mounted at `.ph-root` level, NOT inside `#final-concept`, and that is
  load-bearing.** `position: fixed` escapes 07's layout but not 07's cascade: mounted inside the
  section it picked up the page's single-class image primitives and the sheet was capped at 511px
  (54vh) inside a 663px stage. Outside every section it still gets the route's font variables and
  colour tokens. Its plates reach it through a module-level bus in `handbook-reader.tsx`, so where
  it sits in the tree does not matter to them. The sheet rules are two classes deep as well.
- **The sheet then overflowed the stage anyway, for a second and unrelated reason.** A percentage
  `max-height` on a grid item resolves against its grid area; when the row is content-sized the
  value is cyclic and the browser drops it silently, so `max-height: 100%` did nothing and a
  1132px scan ran under the footer. Fixed by making every row in the chain definite:
  `minmax(0, 1fr)` on the stage row, `align-items: stretch`, flex inside the figure. Measured
  after: sheet 663px in a 663px stage, bottom edge 11px clear of the footer.
- `background: #fff` came off the sheet image. The rendered pages are white to the edge already
  (the rasteriser fills white before drawing), so it was redundant, and without it the drop shadow
  hugs the paper instead of a letterbox.
- MOTION IS OFF still holds (reveal.tsx): no page-turn, no fade between sheets, no transform on
  open. A sheet swaps on the frame the button is pressed. The only transitions are hover/focus
  states on the controls.
- Verified with `npx next build` (clean) and, in the live page, every control driven through the
  DOM: the overview stops at 07/07 with Next relabelled "Show the assembly sheets"; crossing lands
  on 08/53 and reveals the chapter nav; ArrowLeft/Right, Home and End all move; the chapter jump
  lands on 51 with "How to use" marked current; Next is disabled at 53 and Prev at 01; the scroll
  lock sets and releases; Escape, the close button and a backdrop click all close. All three plates
  open on their own sheet.
- Screenshot evidence is thinner than usual: the browser bridge started capturing a different
  window from the one it was reporting viewport metrics for (1536x639 against 1920x799) and
  several captures came back blank while the DOM was demonstrably fine. One good capture shows the
  reader's chrome and the fitted sheet box. The image itself was confirmed decoding by
  `naturalWidth` (1180 x 834 served for the cover), not by eye. **Worth one human look.**
- Flagged, not changed: `handbook-tools-{1200,700}.webp` and `handbook-howto-{1600,900}.webp` are
  referenced by nothing. They predate this session; the reader covers both sheets now (04 and 52),
  so they can go whenever Sylvia wants them gone.

### Post Harvest 06 / 07 — the evaluation photo goes back to portrait, and 07's white band and unreadable handbook pages are fixed (this session)
- Sylvia: "你为什么会选择让section6的所有照片做横屏，我明明觉得它们都适合做竖屏。section 7 的那个长图是什么意思，下面的字也看不清。"
- **06 was landscape for a layout reason, not a photographic one — reverted.** The section's
  dominant was `sketch-review-wide-1600.webp`, a purpose-cut 3:2 crop of the portrait original
  `sketch-review-1600.webp` (1600x2400), made so the picture could run the full canvas as a band
  through `.ph-dominant`'s `max-height:54vh; object-fit:cover`. That cropped it a *second* time:
  measured live at 1368x409 from a 1126x751 source. The frame is vertical — the sheet, both hands
  and the standing farmer only fit top-to-bottom — so the band amputated the top of the sketch and
  the person holding it.
- Now `.ph-06-lead`: a two-column lead at >=1100px (`4.4fr / 7.6fr`). The portrait photograph keeps
  its own proportion on the left (484x725 at a 1536px viewport, `max-height:none`), and the whole
  evaluation argument — the two rounds, the legend bar, the three-way comparison — stacks in the
  column beside it. The conclusion moved *into* that column with `margin-top:auto` so it pins to
  the photograph's bottom edge instead of leaving the column trailing into empty page; that needs
  `align-self:stretch` on `.ph-06-col`, since the row's `align-items:start` would otherwise
  shrink-wrap the column and leave no free space for the auto margin. Below 1100px it stacks, photo
  capped at 440px.
- `#concepts .ph-dominant-tall img` is id-scoped deliberately. `.ph-dominant-tall img` alone ties
  on specificity with `.ph-dominant img`, so it was decided by source order — and in dev, with two
  copies of the stylesheet injected, the 54vh cap won anyway (verified: computed `max-height` came
  back `409.088px` while `object-fit` came back `contain` from the newer rule). `#challenge`
  already overrides the same primitive the same way.
- **07's "long image" was a white background, not an image.** The handbook cover carried
  `width:100%` + `object-fit:contain` + `background:#fff` on a full-canvas box. The scan is 1.41:1
  and the box was ~3.3:1, so the white filled every pixel the letterboxed scan did not: a
  full-width empty white band with a small drawing adrift in the middle of it. `.ph-07-lead` now
  sizes the figure to a 7fr column and lets the image set its own height, so the only white on the
  page is the page (768x542 at 1536px).
- **07's handbook pages were too small to read.** Both are dimensioned instruction spreads and both
  sat in a third-width column capped at `max-height:22vh` — about 424x178px, where none of the step
  text or the cut-list measurements resolve. `.ph-07-pages` makes them a two-up row across the
  canvas (~660px each, cap removed) and the running text + annotations moved beside the cover into
  `.ph-07-aside`. Verified by screenshot: "4x 825 mm (cut 45 deg in each end)" and "Angle iron
  40x40x3 mm" are legible.
- Asset side of this: `sketch-review-*.webp` had been deleted from the working tree as part of
  Sylvia's own pass over `public/post-harvest/photo/` — she re-exported the photographs at higher
  quality and pruned every size nothing referenced. The portrait sketch-review set was pruned
  because, at that moment, only the wide crop was referenced. Restored `sketch-review-1600.webp`
  from HEAD (06 has nothing else to point at), then deleted the four unused sizes
  (600/800/1000/1400) and the now-orphaned `sketch-review-wide-1600.webp`, which matches her
  convention of one file per photograph at the size actually in use.
- **`sketch-review-1600.webp` is still the OLD export and should be redone.** It is 101KB for
  1600x2400 = 0.03 B/px, against 0.16-0.39 B/px across her new batch (`field-walking-2400`,
  `collector-handover-1600`, `road-to-seme-2000`...). It was tolerable as a 1368x409 band; shown
  uncropped at 484x725 the compression is much more exposed. Flagged to her, not fixed — the raw
  is hers.
- Verified with `npx next build` (clean) and live screenshots of both sections at 1536px.
- Flagged, not changed: `concept/concept-box-760.webp` has a dark vertical strip baked into its
  right edge — an export artifact in the source asset, visible in the third comparison frame.

### Unreferenced HALOGRIP design source moved out of `public/media/` into a new `design-source/` (this session)
- Sylvia: "现在项目里的文件好像有点乱，有些重复的文件和图片可以删掉，把所有halogrip项目相关的文件整理一下" —
  audited every `/media/...` path actually referenced by `app/work/halogrip/*` (page.tsx,
  content.ts, concept-carousel.tsx, design-gap-sequence.tsx, sketch-lightbox.tsx,
  interaction-deck.tsx, need-scene.tsx, overview-backdrop.tsx, scroll-intro.tsx) against every
  file physically in `public/media/`. 90 files were git-tracked there (224MB); 33 are actually
  used by the site.
- Confirmed scope with her via `AskUserQuestion` rather than guessing: everything unreferenced
  moves to a new project-root `design-source/` folder (outside `public/`, so it stops being
  publicly deployed by Vercel) instead of being deleted outright — kept for history/reference.
  Used `git mv` throughout so blame/history follows the files.
- Moved: the original pitch-deck source (`Final Presention for claude12.pptx` + its screen
  recording `.mp4`, plus an older `halogrip ppt.pptx`, ~151MB total) into
  `design-source/halogrip-pitch-deck/`; the standalone `section 2 reference/` HTML/CSS prototype
  (its own README confirms it was a reference for 02.2, now implemented in `need-scene.tsx`) to
  `design-source/section 2 reference/`; and every exploratory/reference image not imported by any
  component (alternate concept renders, sketch refinements, `06-sketch-process/`'s reference
  photo, `2.3/`'s and `2.4/`'s reference stills, the `other/skets/` batch, two asset `.zip`s, etc.)
  to `design-source/halogrip图片/`, mirroring `public/media/halogrip图片`'s own subfolder names.
- Deleted outright (not moved): `public/media/~$Final Presention for claude12.pptx`, a PowerPoint
  autosave lock file with no real content — had to wait for Sylvia to close PowerPoint first since
  the source pptx it was locking (`Final Presention for claude12.pptx`) was open and blocked the
  `git mv` with a Windows "Permission denied".
- Verified: re-grepped `app/` for every `/media/` reference after the move and confirmed each
  still resolves inside `public/media/` (nothing referenced was relocated); `public/media/` is now
  33 files instead of 90.
- Gotcha hit while doing this: pre-creating the destination subfolders (e.g.
  `design-source/halogrip图片/2.3/`) before `git mv`-ing a whole source directory of the same name
  into it nests the directory one level deeper than intended (`2.3/2.3/...`) instead of merging —
  had to detect and flatten those with a follow-up `git mv` per file. Don't pre-create the leaf
  directory when the move source is itself a whole directory; only pre-create parents.

### `product-intro` heading rewritten: "NEXT GENERATION STEERING DEVICE" → "EMERGENCY STEERING DEVICE FOR ROBOTAXI" (this session, follow-up)
- Sylvia's direct ask, typo in her own message ("EMERGANCY") corrected to match the spelling used
  everywhere else on the page (section 09's `EMERGENCY HANDOVER`, the root `layout.tsx`/case-study
  `metadata` descriptions). `page.tsx`'s `.product-intro-heading` `<h2>` only — no CSS touched.
- Verified via `npx tsc --noEmit` (clean) and a live screenshot: the longer string (39 vs. 30
  characters) still renders on one line at desktop width with no overflow —
  `.product-intro-heading h2` has no `max-width`/`white-space:nowrap` forcing a break, so this
  would have wrapped gracefully even if it hadn't fit.

### Site renamed from "halogrip-portfolio" to "sylviaxie" across GitHub, Vercel, and local config — HALOGRIP is one case-study project, not the whole site (this session, follow-up)
- Sylvia: "这个网站可以不叫halogrip portfolio吗，halogrip只是我这个项目的名字" — correct: the page
  `<title>`s were already right (`Sylvia Xie — Industrial Designer` on `/`, `HALOGRIP — Sylvia
  Xie` on the case-study page), but the *infrastructure* naming (GitHub repo, Vercel project,
  live domain, `package.json`) all still said "halogrip-portfolio" as if HALOGRIP were the whole
  site rather than its first project. Confirmed the new slug (`sylviaxie`) and scope (rename both
  GitHub and Vercel; don't keep the old domain redirecting) with her via `AskUserQuestion` before
  touching anything public-facing.
- **GitHub**: `gh repo rename sylviaxie --repo sylvia990317-bot/halogrip-portfolio` →
  `sylvia990317-bot/sylviaxie` (GitHub auto-redirects the old URL). Updated the local `origin`
  remote to match (`git remote set-url`).
- **Vercel**: `vercel project rename halogrip-portfolio sylviaxie`. This alone did *not* move the
  live domain — Vercel keeps a project's originally-assigned `<name>.vercel.app` production alias
  pinned as a real "Domain" resource independent of the project's display name, so every
  `vercel --prod` deploy kept auto-aliasing to the old `halogrip-portfolio.vercel.app` even after
  the rename (confirmed live: a full redeploy still printed `Aliased
  https://halogrip-portfolio.vercel.app`). Fixed by explicitly claiming the new domain as a
  project resource — `vercel alias set <latest-deployment> sylviaxie.vercel.app` first (came back
  as a bare alias, which the project's `ssoProtection:{deploymentType:"all_except_custom_domains"}`
  setting doesn't exempt — confirmed via `vercel project protection sylviaxie`, and the new domain
  briefly 302'd to a Vercel SSO login wall), then `vercel domains add sylviaxie.vercel.app
  sylviaxie`, which registers it as a first-class project domain and does get the SSO exemption
  (confirmed: 200, no redirect). Then `vercel alias rm halogrip-portfolio.vercel.app` per Sylvia's
  explicit choice not to keep the old URL working (confirmed old domain now 404s, new one 200s).
  `.vercel/project.json`'s cached `projectName` updated to match.
- **Code/config**: `metadataBase` in both `app/layout.tsx` and `app/work/halogrip/page.tsx`
  (`halogrip-portfolio.vercel.app` → `sylviaxie.vercel.app` — this feeds every relative
  OpenGraph/Twitter image URL Next generates, so it had to move too, not just the visible domain);
  `package.json`'s `name` (`halogrip-portfolio`→`sylviaxie`) and `description` (was literally
  "HALOGRIP — Sylvia Xie | Emergency steering for autonomous vehicles", describing the whole repo
  as if it only contained the HALOGRIP project — changed to "Sylvia Xie — Industrial Designer |
  Portfolio site"); ran `npm install` afterward so `package-lock.json`'s own `name` field
  resynced automatically rather than hand-editing a lockfile. `CLAUDE.md`'s Deployment section
  rewritten with the new domain/repo and a note on why the old domain was deliberately dropped.
- Verified via `npx tsc --noEmit` (clean), a full `vercel --prod --yes` redeploy after all the
  renames, and direct `curl` checks of both domains: `sylviaxie.vercel.app` → `200`,
  `halogrip-portfolio.vercel.app` → `404`.
- **Left uncommitted, by design**: per this project's standing rule (only commit when explicitly
  asked), none of this session's file changes were committed or pushed — the live site was
  updated directly via `vercel --prod --yes` (which deploys from the local working tree,
  independent of git state), so `git status` still shows these edits as pending. `git remote`
  now points at the renamed GitHub repo either way.

### Section-number scheme audited and completed; 02 / CHALLENGE chapter label added; sketch-card hover and sketch lightbox rebuilt; CLOSE PROJECT pill made background-adaptive; 02.2's stat footnote restored with a real citation (this session)
- Sylvia noticed the `[ NN / SECTION ]` eyebrow numbering was inconsistent across the page and
  asked for a proposal to unify it. Audit found the scheme was `01`–`09` for top-level sections
  with `02` alone split into `02.1`–`02.4` sub-scenes, and 3 spots that should have carried a
  sub-number but didn't: `PRODUCT OVERVIEW` → **`07.1 / PRODUCT OVERVIEW`**, `SECURE ACCESS` →
  **`09.1 / SECURE ACCESS`**, `HEAD-UP DISPLAY` → **`09.2 / HEAD-UP DISPLAY`** (`page.tsx`). The
  opening hero's `[ CASE STUDY 001 ]` and the footer's `[ MASTER'S THESIS / 2025 ]` were
  deliberately left unnumbered — they're the page's start/end bookends, not narrative chapters,
  and reading differently from the numbered mid-page sections is intentional.
- **`02 / CHALLENGE` chapter label added** (per Sylvia's spec): a new `.chapter-label` sits above
  the existing `[ CABIN SHIFT ]` eyebrow at the start of the Cabin Shift scene — no new
  full-screen section, no `02.1` (Cabin Shift itself is now unnumbered, just a subsection title
  under the chapter marker; `02.2`–`02.4` on the later sub-scenes are unchanged). Sized between
  the eyebrow and the section `h2` (`--fs-heading-sm`, 24–37px) with `[ ]` brackets matching the
  eyebrow convention. First pass colored it `var(--red)`; Sylvia felt that read as an alert/selected
  marker since red is this page's "attention" accent elsewhere (concept-carousel's `SELECTED
  DIRECTION`, the signal dots) — changed to inherit `.dark-section`'s white, distinguished from
  the eyebrow by size/weight/spacing alone.
- **06 / SKETCH PROCESS card hover rebuilt** (Sylvia: "3张卡片上的字感觉太粗了，看不清" — the card
  titles read too bold/blurry). Root cause: `.dgs-panel h3`/`.dgs-panel-index` set
  `font-weight:700` on `var(--display)` (Koulen), but only Koulen's 400 weight is loaded
  (`page.tsx`'s `Koulen({weight:["400"]})`) — the browser was faux-bolding a font that's already a
  heavy condensed display face, blurring the small (14–20px) card text. Changed both to
  `font-weight:400`. Separately, the sketch-process concept cards' hover ("Remove the red outline
  around the entire card — it makes the tile look selected like an admin UI") turned out to be
  `:focus-visible`, not `:hover` — `ConceptSketchLightbox`'s cards are a `<figure role="button"
  tabIndex={0}>` (deliberately not a `<button>`, see that file's own header comment), and
  Chromium shows a focus-visible outline on a plain mouse click for non-native interactive
  elements, unlike a real `<button>`. Rebuilt the whole interaction to spec: no full-card border,
  card lifts `translateY(-3px)`, image scales `1.025`, title contrast bumps to `#000`, 220ms
  ease, no dimming of the default title/description, `cursor:zoom-in` kept, `:focus-visible`
  reuses the identical treatment (plus a neutral 1px outline, not red) so a click never looks like
  a persistent "selected" tile.
- **Sketch lightbox rebuilt from an image-only preview into an editorial detail panel** (Sylvia:
  "Do not use an image-only lightbox... make it feel like opening a refined portfolio detail
  view, not a browser image preview"). `sketch-lightbox.tsx`: `SKETCHES` gained a `traits: string[]`
  field per concept (2–3 short phrases derived from each concept's existing description); the
  portal now renders `.sketch-lightbox-media` (left, ~68%, `object-fit:contain`, never cropped)
  and `.sketch-lightbox-info` (right, ~32%: number, large title, description, trait list) inside
  one `.sketch-lightbox-dialog` panel instead of a bare `<figure>`. `halogrip.css`: light
  `var(--paper)` panel, 1px `var(--line)` border, soft shadow (no heavy drop shadow), backdrop
  changed from a dark `rgba(15,16,15,.55)` scrim to a light frosted `rgba(249,249,250,.72)` +
  blur so the page stays faintly visible behind it, close button moved from outside the panel
  (`top:-34px`) to inside its top-right corner. Panel capped at `min(80vw,1080px)` / `76vh`. Added
  a `@media(max-width:640px)` stack (image above info) since the 68/32 side-by-side doesn't fit a
  phone width — not in the original spec but required for the redesign to function on mobile.
- **`.sketch-process-converge-result` background** changed `var(--paper)` → `#fff` per Sylvia's
  direct ask ("这个框的背景可以改成纯白吗").
- **CLOSE PROJECT pill made background-adaptive**, in three iterations. (1) First attempt used
  `mix-blend-mode:difference` with no fill (white text only) so the label's rendered color
  auto-inverted against whatever was painted underneath — Sylvia rejected this: "这个按钮怎么会透
  背景啊，不要这样" (why does this button show the background through it, don't do that) — a
  diff-blended fill shows the actual (inverted) pixels of whatever's behind it, which reads as
  translucent/see-through over a photo, not solid. (2) Reworked into two fully opaque states
  toggled by a new client component, **`close-project-button.tsx`**: an `IntersectionObserver`
  (rootMargin collapsed to a 1px band at the fixed button's own screen y, recomputed on resize
  only since a `position:fixed` element's screen position doesn't move on scroll) watches every
  `.dark-section` element plus `.overview` (visually dark but not classed `dark-section`, since
  its dark photo is a separate absolutely-positioned child) and toggles `.is-on-dark`, which
  swaps `background`/`color` between `var(--ink)`/`var(--white)` and the reverse — a real CSS
  transition, no translucency. (3) Sylvia caught a real remaining gap: "经过图片的时候也要保持实心"
  — the toggle is section-level, not pixel-level, so a nominally *light* section can still have a
  locally dark passage (confirmed live: `.product-visual`'s `product-front.webp` has a black grip
  crossing directly under the button inside "07.1 PRODUCT OVERVIEW," a light section) — a dark
  pill over a dark patch of that photo is still fully opaque but reads as low-contrast/blending
  in. Fixed generally rather than special-casing that one image: added a 1px border whose color
  is always the *opposite* tone from the pill's own fill (a light ring on the dark pill, a dark
  ring on the light pill) plus a drop shadow, so the chip's edge is legible from its own internal
  contrast regardless of what's directly behind it — reproduced the exact black-grip overlap live
  and confirmed the ring reads clearly there.
- Verified throughout via `npx tsc --noEmit` (clean after every change) and live dev-server
  checks via `mcp__claude-in-chrome`: screenshotted the new chapter label, the 3 filled-in section
  numbers, the redesigned sketch-card hover (default vs. `:hover`/`:focus-visible`) and the
  rebuilt lightbox panel; for the CLOSE PROJECT pill, scrolled through every light section,
  every `.dark-section`/`.overview` section, and reproduced the exact scroll offset where
  `product-front.webp`'s dark grip crosses the button (via `getBoundingClientRect()`-driven
  `window.scrollTo`, since manual wheel-scroll couldn't reliably re-hit that one frame) to confirm
  each fix live rather than by inspection alone.

### 06 / SKETCH PROCESS — "Interaction detail" stage removed after Sylvia caught it duplicating "Concept convergence"; the 4-vs-1 convergence made explicit with an arrow (this session, follow-up)
- Sylvia: "section 6 的sketch process是不是把4张灰色背景的图片重复了一遍" (did sketch process end up
  repeating the 4 gray-background images?). First check (filenames + a live DOM read) looked clean
  — `sketch-1..4` (Concept convergence) and `refinement-1..4` (Interaction detail) are genuinely
  different files, different hashes. But she pushed back directly: "Concept convergence只是比
  Interaction detail多了一张图，其他四张是一样的" (Concept convergence just has one extra image,
  the other four are the same) — so this time verified by actually **looking at the pixels**
  (`Read` on the PNGs themselves, not just filenames/hashes) rather than trusting the earlier
  histogram-based "different file → different content" assumption. She was right: `sketch-1`/`2`/`3`
  and `refinement-1`/`2`/`3` carry byte-different but content-identical pink hand annotations —
  same text ("Contact remote assistant", "Authorization", "Screen", "NFC Authorization", "Pull
  out", etc.), same handwriting, same positions — confirming `refinement-*` is a separately
  re-exported (and more washed-out) crop of the exact same 4 source sketches `sketch-1..4` already
  show, not a distinct functional-detail set as assumed when this stage was written the entry
  below. Removed the entire "Interaction detail" `.sketch-process-stage` from `page.tsx` (JSX
  only — `06-sketch-process/refinement-*.png` left on disk unused, per this project's standing
  convention for superseded-but-kept assets) and rewrote the intro paragraph from "three stages"
  down to the two that are actually distinct: "exploring different overall forms before converging
  on the pull-out wheel, then refining the grip itself."
- **Lesson applied within the same exchange**: a file-hash/histogram check proves files differ, it
  doesn't prove their *content* differs — Sylvia's correction here is the same category of miss as
  trusting a filename. Any future "are these the same asset" question should default to actually
  opening and looking at the images, not just diffing bytes or metadata.
- Sylvia's immediate follow-up, before the "Interaction detail" removal had even been verified:
  "但是要明确那四张黑底的最终推导出来了右边白底那张" (make it clear the 4 dark ones converge into
  the light one on the right) — the surviving "Concept convergence" row previously just relied on
  the dark/light color difference to imply "this one is the outcome," with all 5 cards in one
  auto-fit grid. Restructured into `.sketch-process-converge` (flex row): the 4 dark exploration
  cards in their own `.sketch-process-grid-converge` (explicit `repeat(2,1fr)` 2×2 grid, per
  Sylvia's own follow-up "可以把四张黑底的做成两行在左边，然后右边是那张白的" — 2 rows on the
  left, the white one on the right — rather than the previous auto-fit row that could lay all 4 out
  flat), a red `→` connector (`.sketch-process-converge-arrow`), then the final sketch on the right
  in its own `.sketch-process-converge-result` figure, now also carrying a small
  "Selected direction" `<figcaption>` (mirroring section 05's own "SELECTED DIRECTION" treatment
  on its final card) so the convergence reads from the label text too, not just position/color.
- **A real bug hit while wiring this up, fixed same-round**: pulling the final-sketch `<figure>`
  out of `.sketch-process-grid-converge` (so it could sit outside the 2×2 grid, next to the arrow)
  silently broke its styling — `.sketch-process-grid figure{border;background}` and
  `.sketch-process-grid figure img{aspect-ratio;object-fit}` are descendant selectors keyed off the
  `.sketch-process-grid` ancestor class, which the relocated figure no longer had. Caught live: the
  result card's `getBoundingClientRect()` came back 649×28px — essentially collapsed, since with no
  `aspect-ratio` the `<img>` had nothing forcing it to take up vertical space. Fixed by giving
  `.sketch-process-converge-result` (and its `img`) their own explicit rules instead of relying on
  the now-severed ancestor relationship; the now-dead `.sketch-process-grid figure.sketch-process-
  card-light` selector (unreachable now that nothing outside `.sketch-process-grid` carries that
  class, and the result figure has its own `background:var(--paper)` directly) was deleted along
  with the now-unused class name in the JSX.
- **Sizing balance fixed in the same round too**: the first pass gave the grid side `flex:1` and the
  result card a fixed `flex:0 0 200px` — Sylvia: "现在左边太大右边太小了" (left is too big now,
  right too small). Changed the result card to `flex:1` as well (equal weight against the grid
  side), which — confirmed live — brought the two sides to near-identical rendered dimensions
  (647×461 vs 649×482) instead of the grid dwarfing a 200px-wide result card.
- Added a mobile (`@media(max-width:760px)`) counterpart: `.sketch-process-converge{flex-direction:
  column}` and the arrow rotated 90° to point downward instead of sideways, since the existing
  mobile `.sketch-process-grid{grid-template-columns:1fr}` rule already collapses the 2×2 exploration
  grid to a single column at that width (wins over the desktop `.sketch-process-grid-converge`
  override via CSS source order — both single-class selectors, mobile block is physically later in
  the file — same mechanism noted in the entry below for why no separate mobile override was needed
  there either).
- Verified via `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` (clean throughout, checked after each of the
  three fixes above) and live `getBoundingClientRect()`/`getComputedStyle()` reads in the dev
  server confirming: the "Interaction detail" stage and its DOM nodes are fully gone; the intro
  paragraph still renders correctly (2 lines) with the new copy; the 2×2 exploration grid and the
  result card render at matching widths/heights with the correct dark/light backgrounds; and the
  "Selected direction" caption is present under the final sketch.

### PRODUCT OVERVIEW: `03 TILT INPUT` / `04 15 KM/H` labels pulled further from the product (this session, follow-up)
- Sylvia's next request, after the annotation-calming round documented below: "03和04可以字稍微离
  3D model远一点吗" (can the 03/04 text sit a bit further from the [product] model). The two
  bottom callouts' dot stayed on the same real anchor points (`page.tsx`'s `PRODUCT_ANNOTATIONS`,
  `point:[0.08,0.8]`/`point:[0.9,0.8]`, still the alpha-verified opaque spots on the grip's lower
  curve from the previous round) — only the `label` fraction moved, `y:1.06→1.16` for both, so the
  gap between the image's own bottom edge and the label text roughly tripled (from ~6% of the
  image's height to ~16%) while the leader line stays a single clean vertical, just longer.
- Verified via `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` (both clean) and a live dev-server
  screenshot: confirmed a clear, deliberate gap between the grip's lower curve and the `03`/`04`
  text, and confirmed the extra 10% of drop still lands comfortably inside `.product-detail`'s
  own bottom padding — no crowding against `[ 08 / INTERACTION MODEL ]` immediately below.

### 06 / SKETCH PROCESS expanded into a 3-stage story, reusing the `05-iteration/` assets Sylvia clarified actually belong to section 6 (this session)
- Sylvia pointed out that `public/media/halogrip图片/05-iteration/` (5 concept-iteration
  sketches — `sketch-1-d-shaped-hud` through `sketch-4-classic-round`, converging on
  `sketch-5-final-pullout-wheel` — plus `sketches.webp`, a 6-round hand-grip-form iteration
  sheet) belongs to section 06, not section 05: those files sat in a `05-iteration`-named folder
  only because they were used in section 05 (CONCEPT EXPLORATION) in an earlier, since-replaced
  round of that section (see the "05 / CONCEPT EXPLORATION replaced again" entry further below —
  section 05 now uses a completely different asset set, `05/concept-*`, and was **not touched**
  by this change; confirmed explicitly with Sylvia after she asked "你的意思是改动第五章节吗，
  那个章节我不想动" (do you mean modifying section 5? I don't want to touch that section) — this
  entire change is scoped to `.sketch-process` in `page.tsx` only).
- Asked Sylvia to walk through the actual story these assets tell (two rounds of
  `AskUserQuestion`, since my first framing of the options wasn't clear): the sketch-process
  narrative actually has 3 stages, not the 1 the section previously showed — (1) exploring
  different overall control-device forms (the 4 `05-iteration/sketch-1..4` concepts: D-shaped
  wheel+HUD, U-shape yoke+on-screen, oblique ellipse+NFC, classic round+voice), converging on
  `sketch-5-final-pullout-wheel` as the selected direction; (2) refining the physical grip shape
  itself (`sketches.webp`'s 6 iteration rounds); (3) working through interaction/functional detail
  on the now-chosen pull-out wheel (the existing `06-sketch-process/refinement-1..4` — the section's
  entire pre-existing content, describing authorization, the pull-out mechanism, NFC, and slide
  rails). The section's intro copy previously only described stage 3 ("Once the pull-out wheel was
  chosen...") since that was all it showed; rewrote it to span all 3 ("Sketching moved through
  three stages: exploring different overall forms, refining the grip itself, then working through
  the interaction points that make the pull-out wheel function.") — still a `TODO(sylvia)` draft.
- Restructured `page.tsx`'s `.sketch-process` section into 3 `.sketch-process-stage` blocks, each
  with a small red mono `.sketch-process-stage-label` caption ("Concept convergence" / "Grip
  refinement" / "Interaction detail") above its content — reusing the section's existing heading
  and intro paragraph as a shared frame rather than duplicating them per stage.
- **Asset format check before styling, not assumed**: sampled all 6 new images via `sharp` raw
  pixel histograms before deciding on card treatment. `sketch-1` through `sketch-4` (PNG) are
  white line art on ~94-95% transparent backgrounds, alpha-antialiased exactly like the existing
  `06-sketch-process/refinement-*` set — so they reuse the same dark-charcoal
  (`.sketch-process-grid figure`, `#3c403d`) card background. `sketch-5-final-pullout-wheel.jpg`
  (no alpha — JPEG) and `sketches.webp` are the opposite: ~88-96% near-white/paper background
  with black ink (`sketches.webp` also carries the pink highlight marks the README/earlier
  changelog entry described). Gave both a light `var(--paper)` card background instead
  (`.sketch-process-card-light` modifier for the sketch-5 card in the concept-convergence grid;
  `.sketch-process-wide` for the full-width grip-refinement figure) — this format split also
  happens to reinforce the narrative for free: the concept-convergence row visually sets the
  "converged" final sketch apart from the 4 dark exploratory ones, the same way section 05's own
  "SELECTED DIRECTION" final card reads differently from its other concepts.
- New CSS: `.sketch-process-stage`/`.sketch-process-stage+.sketch-process-stage` (32px before the
  first stage, 56px between stages — desktop; 24px/40px — mobile, added to the existing
  `@media(max-width:760px)` block), `.sketch-process-stage-label`, `.sketch-process-grid-converge`
  (`grid-template-columns:repeat(auto-fit,minmax(200px,1fr))`, letting the 5-image convergence row
  wrap naturally at medium desktop widths rather than forcing 5 cramped columns), `.sketch-process-
  grid figure.sketch-process-card-light`, `.sketch-process-wide`/`.sketch-process-wide img`
  (`aspect-ratio:1.778` matching `sketches.webp`'s real 1920×1080, `object-fit:contain` — no crop,
  same reasoning as every other dense sketch-sheet asset in this project's history). Moved
  `margin-top` off the base `.sketch-process-grid` rule onto the new `.sketch-process-stage`
  wrapper instead, and dropped the mobile override's redundant `.sketch-process-grid{margin-top:
  24px}` (would have double-stacked with the stage wrapper's own margin) — the existing mobile
  `.sketch-process-grid{grid-template-columns:1fr}` rule already wins over the new
  `.sketch-process-grid-converge` desktop override at ≤760px width via CSS source order (both are
  single-class selectors; the mobile block is physically later in the file), so no separate mobile
  override was needed for the convergence grid specifically.
- Verified via `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` (both clean) and live checks in the dev
  server: re-verified the intro paragraph still renders at exactly 2 lines despite the copy
  rewrite (same `max-width:780px` from the entry below happened to still work); confirmed all 10
  images in the section (`status:200`, correct byte sizes, correct decoded pixel dimensions via
  `fetch`+`createImageBitmap`, matching each file's real dimensions from `sharp` metadata exactly)
  actually load — `<img>.complete`/`.naturalWidth` read as `false`/`0` in this automation session
  despite the images being genuinely loaded and visible (confirmed by `getBoundingClientRect()`
  and `getComputedStyle()` both reporting correct, fully-laid-out boxes) — a DOM-reporting quirk
  of this particular browser session, not a real loading failure, so verification relied on
  `fetch`-based decoding instead of the DOM `<img>` properties; and confirmed via computed
  `background-color` that all 4 concept-convergence exploration cards + all 4 interaction-detail
  cards render the dark charcoal while the sketch-5 card and the grip-refinement figure both
  render the light paper tone.

### PRODUCT OVERVIEW annotations calmed down: shorter lines, secondary type scale, moved clear of the fixed CLOSE PROJECT pill (this session, follow-up)
- Right after the annotation rebuild below shipped, Sylvia said the result was stronger but now
  read as crowded, and asked for a calmer, more compact composition: pull `01 OPEN GRIP` and
  `04 15 KM/H` in from the page's outer margins, keep `02 ID ACCESS` near the center display,
  keep `03 TILT INPUT` on the left/lower side but aligned more cleanly, keep `04` clear of the
  bottom edge, and make all four labels read as secondary supporting detail rather than
  competing with the headline.
- **First pass moved every label to sit *inside* the product photo's own transparent gaps**
  (e.g. `01`'s label tucked between the two grip curves near the top of the frame). Sylvia's
  live feedback on that version, mid-session: "现在的字怎么向内扣，向外更好啊" (why is the text
  curling inward now, outward would be better) — "especially OPEN GRIP." That's the opposite of
  a standard annotation convention (label sits just *outside* the object's silhouette, pointing
  away from it), so it read as text folding back into the product rather than a callout
  supporting it, however short the line was.
- **Final layout**: every callout's label now sits straight outside the image's own silhouette —
  `01`/`02` directly above their point, `03`/`04` directly below — using a single, shared,
  same-x-coordinate point→label pair per callout, so every leader line is a short, clean vertical
  rather than a diagonal. Re-sampled `product-front.webp`'s alpha channel again (same `sharp`
  technique as the original build) to find real opaque anchor points close to — but not at — the
  very outer edge: `01 OPEN GRIP` moved from the grip's widest, most extreme point (`x:0.90`) to
  a point further up the same curve that's already more inward (`x:0.85`); `03`/`04` moved off
  the thin, constant-width vertical hand-bars (which don't offer any more-inward opaque option)
  onto the grip's *lower curve* instead, both around `y:0.80`, which is naturally more central
  than the bars while still reading as "left/lower" and "right/lower." Every label sits just
  outside the 0–1 image frame by a small, consistent margin (`-0.07` above, `1.06` below) rather
  than deep inside the photo's negative space or far out at `1.03`+ like the very first draft —
  short lines, but genuinely outward-pointing ones.
- `PRODUCT_ANNOTATIONS` dropped its per-item `corner` field entirely — since every label now uses
  the identical "centered, growing upward from its anchor" transform, `page.tsx` renders one
  shared `.product-annotation` class with no modifier, and `halogrip.css` collapsed the old
  `--tr`/`--tc`/`--bl`/`--br` variants into that single base rule.
- **Also addressed, raised live by Sylvia mid-verification**: "可以稍微整体向左边移动一点，现在容易被
  close project的按钮挡到" (shift the whole thing slightly left, it's easy for the fixed CLOSE
  PROJECT pill to block it right now) — `.product-visual` width reduced `100%→88%` inside its
  grid column (stays left-aligned by default, so this only pulls its *right* edge in), giving
  `01`'s point/label real clearance from the always-visible fixed pill instead of sitting right
  under it while scrolling through the top of this section.
- **Secondary-feel typography**: `.product-annotation strong` (the callout title) dropped from
  `var(--fs-card-title-sm)` (24px, the same tier as real card headings elsewhere on the page) to
  a fixed 16px — still comfortably above the project's own "nothing under 12px" floor (see the
  Koulen/Roboto Mono type-scale entry further below), but now unmistakably smaller and lighter
  than the section headline, so the four callouts read as supporting annotation rather than a
  second competing headline tier. The connecting `<line>` also picked up `stroke-opacity:.6` for
  the same reason.
- Section padding/spacing tightened alongside this for an overall calmer feel:
  `.product-detail`'s bottom padding `clamp(90,9vw,140)`→`clamp(72,8vw,120)`,
  `.product-visual`'s `margin-top` `6%`→`4%` (top padding above the headline — the "generous
  negative space around the title" Sylvia asked to preserve — was left untouched).
- Verified via `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` (both clean) and live dev-server checks:
  re-sampled the new anchor coordinates' alpha values directly (confirmed every `point` opaque,
  every `label` off the raster entirely by construction) before writing them, then checked real
  `getBoundingClientRect()`s for all 4 labels against the fixed `.close-project` pill's own rect
  at the scroll position where `01` first comes into view — confirmed ~35px of horizontal
  clearance and no vertical overlap — and screenshotted the finished section: headline upper-left
  with clear surrounding space, product dominant and centered, all four short vertical leader
  lines landing cleanly outside the grip/display silhouette with `03`/`04` aligned at the same
  height for a tidy symmetric bottom pair.

### PRODUCT OVERVIEW rebuilt: plain 2×2 spec grid replaced with industrial-design annotation callouts (this session)
- Sylvia asked to keep the section's light background and overall two-part layout (copy upper-left,
  product large on the right) but replace the flat `.final-specs` 2×2 card grid with four annotation
  callouts (`01 OPEN GRIP`/`02 ID ACCESS`/`03 TILT INPUT`/`04 15 KM/H`) connected to the product photo
  by thin leader lines + small numbered red markers — reading as industrial-design annotations, not UI
  cards, with the product itself staying dominant and red used only as a small numbering accent.
- **Anchor points were pixel-sampled, not guessed.** Read `product-front.webp`'s raw alpha channel
  directly via `sharp` (see the alpha-mask grid dumped during this session) to find exactly where the
  device geometry is opaque vs. where the PNG is transparent, so each callout's dot lands on real
  product surface (right grip curve for OPEN GRIP, the display's NFC icon for ID ACCESS, the two
  vertical hand-bars either side of the display for TILT INPUT/15 KM/H) and each label lands in
  genuinely empty space — keeping every leader line short instead of crossing over the photo.
- `page.tsx`: new `PRODUCT_ANNOTATIONS` const (fractional `point`/`label` coordinates against the
  image's own 2100×1032 frame, plus a `corner` key for label alignment) replaces the old inline
  `[["OPEN GRIP","RECOGNIZABLE"],...]` 2×2 array. The `.product-detail` section now renders
  `.product-copy` (eyebrow + heading only, no more `.final-specs`) and a `.product-visual` wrapper
  holding the real `<img>`, one `<svg viewBox="0 0 2100 1032">` overlay (a thin `<line>` + small red
  `<circle>` per callout), and 4 absolutely-positioned `.product-annotation` label divs (number/title/
  note, no border/background) — all sharing one percentage coordinate space against the image so lines
  and labels stay aligned at any viewport width.
- **Layout bug found and fixed while verifying live, not assumed correct from the code alone**:
  `.product-detail` originally kept `.product-visual` `position:absolute` inside a hand-picked
  `min-height:960px` section — since the absolutely-positioned visual doesn't contribute to flow
  height, the section rendered ~300px of dead whitespace below the product before the next section
  started. Rebuilt `.product-detail` as a real CSS grid (`grid-template-columns:min(430px,34%) 1fr`,
  `align-items:start`) with `.product-copy` and `.product-visual` as normal grid items — this also
  satisfies "title/intro on the upper-left" directly via `align-items:start`, and the section's height
  now falls out of actual content instead of a guessed constant. Also caught (via a live
  `getBoundingClientRect()` check, not visual inspection) that the top-right and bottom-right labels'
  first-draft offsets (`label:[1.03, …]`) rendered past the browser viewport's right edge at a normal
  desktop width — pulled both inward (`[0.8,-0.06]` and `[0.84,1.05]`) so they read on-screen at any
  reasonable width instead of being clipped.
- Mobile (`@media(max-width:760px)`): `.product-visual` becomes a normal static full-width block below
  the copy, the SVG leader-line overlay is hidden, and the 4 `.product-annotation` divs fall back to a
  simple stacked list (red index number + title + note, hairline top border) — reusing the same visual
  grammar the old `.final-specs` mobile rule used, since a corner-offset floating annotation doesn't
  read cleanly at phone width.
- Verified via `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` (both clean) and live dev-server checks: sampled
  every annotation's real `getBoundingClientRect()` to confirm none overflow the viewport, screenshotted
  the full section top-to-bottom (headline upper-left, product dominant on the right, all 4 short
  leader lines landing cleanly on grip/display geometry with no crossing, red used only on the index
  numbers/dots), and confirmed the mobile stacked-list fallback via a scratch `!important` CSS override
  at the current viewport (the same technique other entries in this file use for the same
  non-resizable-automation-viewport limitation).

### 06 / SKETCH PROCESS — card background lightened then walked back to a softer charcoal (not full light, not near-black); white line art tried as black, then reverted; red index numbers removed; intro paragraph forced to 2 lines (this session)
- Sylvia's first ask: `.sketch-process-grid figure`'s dark card background (`var(--dark)`,
  `#1b1f1e`) felt too jarring against the page's light overall palette — asked to swap it to a
  light background and recolor the sketches' white line work to black to match.
- Confirmed via `sharp` (raw pixel histogram) that the 4 `06-sketch-process/refinement-*.png`
  files are white line art on a transparent background, antialiased through the **alpha**
  channel at a near-constant white RGB (~250-255), not through RGB blending — plus a separate
  pink/magenta annotation color untouched by any of this work. Backed up the 4 originals to the
  session scratchpad, then recolored every grayscale ("white ink") pixel to pure black
  (`(0,0,0)`, alpha left untouched) in place with a `sharp` raw-buffer script, leaving the pink
  annotation pixels alone — verified after the fact via a fresh pixel histogram (0% white pixels
  remained, black + pink present in the expected proportions) and again by fetching the actual
  served asset bytes in-browser (not a cached copy) and sampling them the same way. Card
  background changed to `var(--paper)` to match.
- Sylvia's follow-up: "看来似乎不能换成黑色的线条" (turns out we can't switch to black line
  work after all) — read as: black ink didn't hold up visually, most likely because a lot of
  this line art's own alpha is well below 100% throughout the stroke (not just at antialiased
  edges — confirmed earlier via direct pixel sampling, e.g. alpha values of 51-238 scattered
  across "solid" strokes), so a black stroke at, say, 50% alpha over near-white paper reads as a
  faint light gray — much lower contrast than the same 50%-alpha *white* stroke over a dark
  card. Reverted: restored the 4 original white-line PNGs from the scratchpad backup (confirmed
  via a fresh pixel histogram: white ink pixels back to 70-85% of non-transparent pixels per
  file), and re-asked for "较深但不是全黑" (dark, but not full black) instead of a full light
  background. `.sketch-process-grid figure` background changed to `#3c403d`, a soft charcoal —
  clearly dark enough to keep the white line work legible (same contrast logic the assets were
  originally authored for) while reading softer than `var(--dark)` against the surrounding light
  page. No named CSS token was introduced for this one-off value — only one selector uses it.
- Removed the red `01`/`02`/`03`/`04` index number shown on each card (Sylvia: "不要卡片上的红色
  数字"): deleted the `<span>0{index + 1}</span>` in `page.tsx`'s `.sketch-process-grid` map
  (and the now-unused `index` param from the `.map()` callback) and the matching
  `.sketch-process-grid figure span` rule in `halogrip.css`.
- `.sketch-process-intro`'s intro paragraph ("Once the pull-out wheel was chosen...") was
  wrapping to 3 lines at its `max-width:620px`; Sylvia asked for 2 ("变成两行"). Measured live in
  the dev server (temporarily overriding `max-width` and reading `getBoundingClientRect().height`
  against the computed line-height) that the 3→2 line threshold sits at exactly 750px, and that
  760px onward gives a well-balanced split ("...working through the interaction " / "points that
  make it function: authorization, the pull-out mechanism, and on-wheel controls." — a
  106-vs-98-character split, close to even). Set `max-width:780px` for a small safety margin
  above the threshold. No mobile-breakpoint override existed or was needed — mobile's own
  narrower viewport already constrains the paragraph well below 780px regardless.
- Verified via `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` (clean at every step) and live checks in
  the dev server throughout — the actual served image bytes were sampled directly (via `fetch` +
  `createImageBitmap` + `OffscreenCanvas`, not the cached DOM `<img>`) both when converting to
  black and again after reverting to white, and the intro paragraph's final rendered line count
  was confirmed at exactly 2 lines. Live screenshots of this page are unreliable in this
  environment (see the extensive WebGL-tab-capture notes elsewhere in this file) — pixel/DOM
  verification was used throughout instead of relying on screenshots.

### 05 / CONCEPT EXPLORATION — sketch cards enlarged (root cause: an undocumented "fit to one viewport" constraint was starving the deck of space), a resulting overlap bug fixed, the heading replaced, and the on-card label removed (this session)
- Sylvia: "section 5 图片太小了，看不清" (section 5's images are too small, can't see clearly).
  Measured live in the dev server rather than guessing from CSS: the active `.concept-deck-card`
  was rendering at only 224×157px. Root cause traced to a desktop-only `@media(min-width:761px)`
  block in `halogrip.css` (not documented elsewhere in this file — apparently added in an
  undocumented session) that fits the whole section — eyebrow, heading, intro paragraph, the
  sketch stage, and the below-stage copy — inside one viewport with no internal scrolling.
  `.concept-deck-row`'s `min-height:200px` was meant to be a last-resort safety floor, but in
  practice the heading/copy/padding overhead routinely pushed the row down to exactly that floor
  even on ordinary-height screens, and `.concept-deck-card{width:66%}` only filled two-thirds of
  the already-small resulting stage.
- Fix prioritizes legibility over the strict one-viewport fit: raised `.concept-deck-row`'s floor
  from `200px` to `420px`, and `.concept-deck-card`'s fill of the stage from `66%` to `80%`. The
  section's `min-height:100vh` (not `height:100vh`) already tolerates growing past one viewport
  and letting the page scroll a little more on short screens — an intentional existing fallback,
  not a new risk — so trading some of the "always fits in one screen" guarantee for a legible
  card (571×399px after the fix, confirmed live) was the accepted call. No changes needed in
  `concept-carousel.tsx`'s `STAGE_RATIO` or its `ResizeObserver` sizing logic — they simply
  resolve larger once the CSS inputs changed.
- **Regression found and fixed from the enlargement itself**: the four faded "fanned" background
  cards are positioned by GSAP `xPercent`/`yPercent` on `SLOT_STYLE` in `concept-carousel.tsx`,
  which resolve as a percentage of each card's own (now much bigger) untransformed box — so the
  same percentages produced a much larger absolute pixel spread than before, and the upper corner
  cards bled up into the heading/intro-paragraph area. Sylvia flagged this directly, having seen
  it before the cause was identified: "这行小字现在被挡住了" (this line of small text is now
  covered). Tightened `ul`/`ll`/`ur`/`lr`'s `yPercent` (the only axis implicated) from
  `-31/35/-33/36` to `-18/21/-20/22`, verified live via `getBoundingClientRect()` until there was
  clean positive clearance (13-17px) on both sides again.
- **Heading replaced**: "HOW SHOULD CONTROL APPEAR IN A VEHICLE DESIGNED WITHOUT IT?" was the
  only question-form `<h2>` anywhere on the page (every other section heading is a short,
  declarative, period-ended statement) — Sylvia flagged it as weak copy. Presented 4 alternatives
  in the page's existing voice via `AskUserQuestion`; she picked **"FIVE DIRECTIONS FOR
  CONTROL."** — echoes section 06's own "REFINING THE SELECTED DIRECTION." right after it, and
  being one line avoids the 3-line-wrap-eats-vertical-space issue an earlier session had already
  flagged on this exact heading.
- **On-card label removed** (Sylvia: "卡上的CONCEPT 04A / Touch Screen 这种小字删掉"): deleted the
  `<span className="concept-deck-card-label">` (concept number + title, shown on every card) from
  `concept-carousel.tsx` and its 3 matching CSS rules (`.concept-deck-card-label`, `...-label em`,
  `...-label-text`) — the concept name still shows in the readout below the stage for whichever
  card is active, just not duplicated on the card itself anymore.
- Verified via `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` (clean throughout) and live interaction
  testing in the dev server: re-measured card/stage geometry before and after each change,
  confirmed clean clearance around the corner cards with no overlap, and — after ruling out a
  false alarm that first looked like a real bug (GSAP's per-card opacity/scale momentarily out of
  sync with React's own `index` state; matches a previously-documented Fast-Refresh artifact in
  this exact component, confirmed by re-testing with a clean settle time and no concurrent file
  edits in flight) — confirmed a full arrow-key run through all 5 concepts: correct opacity/scale
  per step, and the final card correctly fades every other sketch to `opacity:0` while showing
  "SELECTED DIRECTION — CONCEPT 02" / "Pull-Out Wheel" alone.

### 09 EMERGENCY HANDOVER's 5 story-grid PNGs recolored in place to close the seam the previous entry flagged (this session, follow-up)
- The previous entry's `.journey` change left a real, flagged seam: the 5
  `09-handover/{01-authorize,02-activate,03-reposition,04-park,05-complete}.png` storyboard
  sketches have their canvas background baked in at `#f3f2ee`, and the section around them had
  just moved to `#f9f9fa`. Sylvia asked directly whether the images' own backgrounds could be
  changed, so — unlike the "flag, don't touch assets" stance earlier in this same session, which
  was about *silently* patching a mismatch with a filter/blend-mode hack — this is an explicit,
  scoped request to edit these 5 files for real.
- Edited the pixels directly with `sharp` (already a transitive dependency via Next's image
  pipeline, no new package installed): measured each file's dominant fill color first
  (histogram of raw RGB — `#f3f2ee`/`(243,242,238)` was 51-76% of every image's pixels, confirming
  a flat baked canvas, not a photo), then shifted every pixel *toward* `(249,249,250)` by an
  amount proportional to how close that pixel already was to the old background color: pixels
  within a tight radius of pure `#f3f2ee` get the full `+6/+7/+12` shift, pixels farther than a
  slightly wider radius (i.e. actual pencil/ink strokes, the black border, the red annotation
  marks) get none, and pixels in between — the anti-aliased blend between ink and canvas — get a
  proportional partial shift, which is the physically-correct way to recolor a canvas under
  antialiased line art without banding at stroke edges. Verified after the fact, not just assumed:
  every pixel darker than a mid-gray threshold (luminance <180 — i.e. all real artwork, borders,
  and annotations) diffed at exactly 0 against a backup of the originals; only near-background
  pixels moved. Post-edit, each file's new dominant color samples at exactly `(249,249,250)`.
- Originals backed up to the session scratchpad before editing (not committed anywhere) in case a
  future session needs to re-derive a different target color; the working files in
  `public/media/halogrip图片/09-handover/` are the edited versions.
- Verified with a live screenshot + zoom crop across a panel edge in the dev server: no visible
  seam anywhere around any of the 5 images, on the now-flat `--paper` `.journey` background.

### Background system simplified further: the "local diagram backdrop" tone dropped, every light surface is now flat --paper (this session, follow-up)
- Right after the two-tone pass below shipped, Sylvia said to collapse it further: "浅色除去开头
  动画还是都改成#F9F9FA吧" (make every light color #F9F9FA too, except the opening animation) —
  she didn't want a second light-gray "panel" tone at all, just one flat main background
  everywhere light, with the pinned 3D intro's own scene left alone (it already resolves to
  `--paper` at rest, so nothing further was needed there).
- `halogrip.css`: removed the `--paper-light` custom property entirely and rewrote the `:root`
  comment to describe one `--paper` token. Its 3 remaining consumers were repointed straight at
  `--paper`: `.concept-deck-arrow`, `.interaction`, and `.journey`.
- **`.journey` (09 EMERGENCY HANDOVER) is the one place this has a real, flagged cost**: the
  entry below explains that this section was deliberately kept at a hardcoded `#f3f2ee` because
  the 5 `09-handover/*.png` story-grid images have that exact color baked into their own canvas
  background — moving it to `#f9f9fa` (a ~6/255-per-channel shift) now puts a faint but real seam
  around each of those 5 panels that didn't exist before this follow-up. Left a comment on the
  rule explaining this is a known, accepted tradeoff per Sylvia's explicit instruction, not an
  oversight — fixing it for real would mean re-exporting those 5 PNGs with the new background
  baked in, which is an asset change, not a CSS one.
- Verified via `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` (both clean) and a live computed-style
  check confirming `body`, `.research`, `.principles`, `.concepts`, `.sketch-process`,
  `.concept-deck-arrow`, `.interaction`, `.journey`, and `.scroll-intro` all resolve to
  `rgb(249, 249, 250)`.

### Background system unified: three tokens (main / local-diagram-backdrop / dark) replace a drifted mix of near-beige hexes (this session)
- Sylvia asked to fix visible color banding between sections caused by several near-duplicate
  off-white/warm-gray backgrounds (`#eaeae6`, `#f3f2ee`, plus one-off dark hexes) that had drifted
  apart over many earlier sessions, and to consolidate them into a real system: one main
  background, one "local diagram backdrop" tone for panels that host a graphic/demo rather than
  running text, and the existing kept-dark display background — as CSS variables, not scattered
  literals.
- `halogrip.css` `:root`: `--paper` (main background) changed `#eaeae6`→**`#f9f9fa`**;
  `--paper-light` (repurposed as the local diagram-backdrop tone — the interaction-model demo,
  the concept-deck's arrow buttons) changed `#f3f2ee`→**`#eceef0`**; `--dark` (`#1b1f1e`) was
  already the target value, unchanged. A `:root` comment documents each token's role. Every
  selector that referenced these two tokens by name (body, `.scroll-intro`,
  `.scroll-intro-preload`, `.concept-deck-arrow`, `.interaction`) picked up the new values
  automatically; hardcoded literals equal to the old tokens were repointed at the variables
  instead: `.overview-bg-fade`'s gradient (was raw `rgba(234,234,230,…)`, hardcoded rather than
  `var()` since gradients needed a literal alpha at the time it was written), `.cabin-figure`'s
  placeholder background (`#101211`→`var(--dark)`), `.dgs-fb-panel`'s reduced-motion fallback
  background (`#050505`→`var(--dark)`), `scroll-intro.tsx`'s `PAPER` JS constant (the GSAP-tweened
  color the pinned intro settles to right before `#product-intro`, `#eaeae6`→`#f9f9fa`, with a
  comment to keep it in sync with the CSS token since GSAP can't read a CSS custom property here).
- **`.research` moved off `--paper-light` onto `--paper`** — per Sylvia's explicit list, Research,
  Design Principles, Concepts, and Sketch Process (03-06) should read as one continuous
  main-background run, not have Research sit on the "panel" tone.
- **`.principles` converted from a dark section to the same continuous main background** — this
  was the actual fix for the "run of four," since Principles (`dark-section`, `var(--dark)`) sat
  in the middle of that run and broke it. Removed `dark-section` from its `<section>` in
  `page.tsx`; `halogrip.css` gives it its own explicit `background:var(--paper)`. Per Sylvia's
  explicit follow-up instruction, every color that had been tuned for white-on-dark got adjusted
  for the new light background: `.principles-intro>p` and `.principles-list article p` (both were
  light grays like `#d2d4cf`/`#c9ccc7`) now use `var(--muted)`; `.principles-list article`'s
  divider (`#515553`) now uses `var(--line)`. Headings/index numbers needed no change — they had
  no explicit color, so removing `dark-section`'s `color:var(--white)` override lets them fall
  back to `body`'s own `var(--ink)` automatically, and the red index numbers/accent span already
  matched the exact pattern `.research-findings` uses on a light background.
- **One deliberate exception, found by sampling the actual asset pixels, not assumed**: `.journey`
  (section 09 / EMERGENCY HANDOVER) still hardcodes `background:#f3f2ee` — the *old*
  `--paper-light` value — rather than following the token's new `#eceef0`. The 5 story-grid PNGs
  under `09-handover/` have `#f3f2ee` baked into their own canvas per Sylvia's original spec for
  that section (see the entry further below), confirmed by sampling a flat pixel region of
  `01-authorize.png` directly (`~rgb(241,240,236)`, matching `#f3f2ee`, not `#eceef0` or the new
  `#f9f9fa`) — moving this section onto the new panel tone would have introduced exactly the kind
  of seam this whole pass was meant to remove. Left with an explanatory comment in the CSS so a
  future session doesn't "fix" it back onto the token.
- **Chapter-pause dividers added, whitespace trimmed slightly at the seams that got them**: now
  that Research/Principles/Concepts/Sketch Process share one flat background with no color
  contrast between them, a hairline `border-top:1px solid var(--line)` was added to `.principles`,
  `.concepts`, and `.sketch-process` (not `.research`, which still follows the dark 02.4 scene —
  contrast alone still signals that break) so each chapter start still reads as a deliberate pause
  rather than a random line break. With the divider now doing some of that signaling work, the
  padding immediately on either side of each new seam was trimmed ~15-25%: `.principles`'s
  `padding-block` split into `padding-top:clamp(46px,6vw,84px)` (was 64/8vw/110, bottom kept
  unchanged) + `padding-bottom:clamp(64px,8vw,110px)`; `.concepts.section`'s `padding-top`
  (761px+ media query) `clamp(48px,6vw,84px)`→`clamp(40px,5vw,72px)`; `.sketch-process`'s
  `padding-block` `clamp(63px,8.5vw,105px)`→`clamp(52px,7vw,90px)`. Mobile breakpoint values were
  not touched (same reasoning as every earlier density pass in this file: the complaint/fix here
  is about desktop's now-redundant color+whitespace double-signal, not mobile).
- **Considered and rejected**: recoloring `.concept-deck-card` (the sketch-carousel's white card
  panel, section 05) from `#fff` to the new `--paper-light` as a "local diagram backdrop" — sampling
  all 5 `05/concept-*` sketch images directly showed they're flat `#ffffff`, an exact match to the
  card's existing background; recoloring the card to `#eceef0` would have *created* a seam around
  every sketch that doesn't exist today, the opposite of this session's goal. Left untouched.
- **3D intro scene checked, not touched**: `scroll-intro-scene.tsx` sets no `scene.background` or
  renderer clear color of its own — the `<canvas>` is `background:transparent` and shows whatever
  sits behind it in the DOM, so once `.scroll-intro`/`.scroll-intro-preload`/the `PAPER` tween
  above were repointed at the new token, the opening scene's resting-state background matches the
  rest of the page automatically. No material or lighting code in that file was touched.
- Verified via `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` (both clean, run twice), computed-style
  checks in the dev server confirming every listed selector resolves to the intended hex, and —
  unusually for this project (most earlier sessions in this file hit a WebGL-tab-capture bug that
  produced blank screenshots, documented at length elsewhere here) — real, successful screenshots
  this time: confirmed the `.principles`→`.concepts` hairline divider renders as a clean, subtle
  seam on a continuous background, confirmed Design Principles itself now reads correctly as dark
  ink-on-light-paper with legible muted body copy and dividers, confirmed the `sketches.webp`
  sheet (section 06) blends into the new `#f9f9fa` background with no visible edge in practice
  despite the two tones not being bit-identical, and confirmed the 09-handover storyboard panels
  still sit on their originally-matched `#f3f2ee` with no seam.
- **Asset boundaries checked directly (pixel-sampled via `sharp`, not guessed) — none need fixing
  yet, none were modified**: `sketches.webp`'s own background samples at `#fffffe`-ish, technically
  not bit-identical to the new `#f9f9fa` main background it now sits directly against with no
  frame, but the gap is small enough (~6/255 per channel) that it read as invisible in an actual
  screenshot — flagging in case a future, more color-critical pass wants it closer. No other
  asset showed a mismatch worth flagging: the `05/concept-*` sketches and `09-handover/*` PNGs are
  exact-matched to the panels holding them (see above); `product-front.webp`/`product-detail.webp`/
  `product-side.webp` all decode with real alpha transparency (not a flat color), so they have no
  background of their own to clash with anything; `id-one.webp`/`id-two.webp`/`hud.webp` are
  intentionally dark opaque UI-screen mockups sitting on a light section by design, not an
  accidental beige/white mismatch. Per Sylvia's instruction, no filter or blend-mode was added or
  removed on any of these to mask a boundary — the two pre-existing `mix-blend-mode:multiply` uses
  (`.product-detail>img`, `.interaction-demo>img`) were left exactly as found.
- Not touched, out of scope for this pass: copy, content order, model animation, and the page's
  overall layout — confirmed by keeping every edit to `background`/`color`/`border-color`/
  `padding` declarations (plus the two class-list changes needed to move Principles off
  `dark-section`), never touching a selector's structural properties.

### 02.2 REAL-WORLD NEED — route line now draws itself in, synced to the annotations/frame/stat (this session)
- Sylvia asked for animation on the previously fully-static 02.2 poster: the route line should
  draw itself in, with the text/annotations appearing one by one as the line reaches each point
  ("字也有跟着线的显示一个个出现"), and confirmed (via `AskUserQuestion`) this should extend to
  every element on the poster — the vehicle frame + "74" stat and the `RESPONSE ORIGIN` block too
  — synced to the line's own draw progress, not a fixed independent stagger. Per the section's
  existing design (a static, percentage/`vw`-positioned "poster" — see the entry below on why),
  this is a one-shot reveal-on-scroll-into-view, not a scroll-scrubbed or pinned scene — no
  `pin-coordinator.ts` wiring needed since this creates no pin.
- Extracted the section out of `page.tsx` into a new client component, **`app/work/halogrip/
  need-scene.tsx`** (`NeedScene`, `"use client"`), following the same per-scene-file convention as
  `overview-backdrop.tsx`/`design-gap-sequence.tsx`/`concept-carousel.tsx`. `page.tsx` now just
  renders `<NeedScene />`.
- **The draw-in mechanism**: `.need-route`/`.need-route-glow` already carry their own
  `stroke-dasharray` for visual styling (a dashed line + a blurred glow), so animating their own
  `stroke-dashoffset` for a reveal would fight that pattern. Instead added an invisible solid copy
  of the same path inside a new `<mask id="need-route-reveal">`; on mount, JS measures
  `getTotalLength()`, sets that copy's own `stroke-dasharray`/`stroke-dashoffset` to its full
  length (hidden), and a GSAP tween counts `dashoffset` down to 0 — revealing the real two paths
  underneath via the mask without ever touching their own dash styling.
- **Timing is derived from the path's real geometry, not hand-picked percentages**: a
  `fractionAt(x, y)` helper samples the path (400 steps via `getPointAtLength`) to find what
  fraction of the total length the draw-in reaches by the time it passes closest to a given
  target point. This is used to time every other reveal off the same GSAP timeline: annotation
  `01 BLOCKED ROADS` fades in (opacity+`y`) right as the line passes its dot, the vehicle frame +
  "74" stat fade in as the line passes the frame's left edge, then `02`/`03` as the line reaches
  their own dots, then `RESPONSE ORIGIN` + the source line once the line finishes drawing (at
  fraction 1). SVG elements (leader lines/dots, the frame's rect/corner paths) animate opacity
  only; HTML elements (the annotation `<div>`s, stat, origin, source) also get a small
  translateY. Triggered via a plain one-shot `ScrollTrigger.create({ start:"top 70%", once:true,
  onEnter })`, deferred behind `onPinsReady(["scroll-intro"], ...)` (consuming only — this
  component doesn't register itself in `pin-coordinator.ts`'s `Source` union since nothing
  downstream depends on it) so its trigger measures against the final, post-pin document layout
  rather than baking in a too-short pre-pin position.
- `prefers-reduced-motion` skips building the timeline entirely: the mask's dashoffset is set
  straight to 0 and the poster just renders in its finished state, no motion — matching every
  other reduced-motion fallback on this page. No new CSS was needed for the pre-reveal hidden
  state (GSAP sets `opacity:0` directly only when it's actually going to animate something in, so
  a no-JS/reduced-motion visitor never sees anything stuck invisible).
- **Fixed a real static-layout issue found while building this**: the route's own coordinates ran
  straight through the red frame box in the middle (flat at `y=500` across `x745-960`, inside the
  frame's own `y435-670` span) — the dashed line visibly cut across the boxed stalled vehicle.
  Sylvia's first ask was to reroute the path around the box; she then clarified she actually wanted
  the line to simply stop before the box and resume after it, reading as passing *behind* the box
  rather than bending around it ("框原本的那段不显示，过了框以后再续上"). Implemented with a second,
  static mask (`#need-frame-cutout`): a full-canvas white rect with a black rect cut out over the
  frame's own bounds (plus a small pad for the glow's blur), nested as an outer `<g>` wrapping the
  reveal-mask `<g>` from above — so the line's rendered stroke is unconditionally absent inside the
  frame's footprint regardless of draw progress, while the path's real (unbent) geometry is still
  what every `fractionAt()` timing calculation runs against.
- Verified via `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` (both clean) and real mouse-wheel scrolling
  in the dev server: confirmed the pre-reveal state (dashoffset at full length, every synced
  element at opacity 0) before the section enters view; confirmed the line draws left-to-right and
  visibly disappears under the frame box and reappears cleanly on the other side with no line
  crossing the box; confirmed `01`/`02`/`03`, the frame+"74" stat, and `RESPONSE ORIGIN`+source
  each appear in the correct order tied to the line's own progress (checked both via screenshots
  and by reading `getComputedStyle().opacity`/`strokeDashoffset` mid-scroll); confirmed no console
  errors across two fresh page loads.

### Section padding-block tightened ~30% after the mason-wong.com resize made the page feel "too zoomed in" (this session, follow-up)
- Right after the previous entry's literal-pixel resize, Sylvia reported the whole page now feels
  too large/dense — needing to zoom the browser out to 60-75% to see a full section at once. An
  Explore agent audit ruled out the font sizes themselves as fixed-container overflow bugs (the
  handful of fixed-height containers it flagged — `.close-project`, `.interaction-buttons button`,
  `.final-specs` — all use `min-height`/auto-growing layout, so bigger text just grows the box, it
  doesn't clip); the real cause is additive density: HALOGRIP has far more small-text elements per
  page (metadata grids, findings lists, footers, index numbers) than mason-wong.com's sparser
  layout, so flattening every small tier to mason's 12px floor compounds across dozens of elements
  even though each individual change was small. Sylvia's explicit direction (confirmed via
  `AskUserQuestion`): don't touch font sizes again — they should stay pinned to mason's numbers —
  tighten the surrounding whitespace instead.
- Cut the 7 largest section-level `padding-block` values in `halogrip.css` by ~30% (min/max/vw all
  scaled down together, selectors untouched): `.section` `clamp(108px,15vw,205px)`→
  `clamp(76px,10.5vw,144px)`, `.challenge-scene` `clamp(100px,14vw,170px)`→`clamp(70px,10vw,120px)`,
  `.principles` `clamp(135px,17vw,220px)`→`clamp(95px,12vw,154px)`, `.concepts` (bottom only)
  `160px`→`112px`, `.sketch-process` `clamp(90px,12vw,150px)`→`clamp(63px,8.5vw,105px)`, `.journey`
  `clamp(130px,16vw,205px)`→`clamp(91px,11vw,144px)`, `.site-footer` `130px 40px`→`92px 40px`. The
  `@media(max-width:760px)` mobile overrides for these same selectors were deliberately **left
  untouched** — Sylvia's complaint was specifically about desktop browser zoom, and mobile was
  already noticeably tighter than desktop before this change; `--gutter` (horizontal shell padding)
  was also left alone since the complaint was about vertical density, not horizontal.
- While investigating, the Explore agent flagged `.concept-deck-card-label` (section 05's per-card
  "CONCEPT 01 / Screen + External Device" label) as a possible risk: it sits `flex:none` above a
  `flex:1` image inside an `aspect-ratio`-locked (not auto-height) card, so if the label text
  wrapped to 2 lines it would visibly steal height from the image. Live `getBoundingClientRect()`
  checks initially looked alarming (heights up to 58px against an 18px single-line baseline) —
  but cross-checking against `offsetHeight` (which ignores CSS transforms) showed every label is
  actually a clean single line at 18px; the inflated `getBoundingClientRect()` numbers were purely
  a side effect of the non-active cards' GSAP rotation transform enlarging their axis-aligned
  bounding box, not real text wrapping. **No live bug existed**, but added a small defensive fix
  anyway since it's free insurance against a genuinely long future concept title: wrapped the label
  text in its own `<span className="concept-deck-card-label-text">` in `concept-carousel.tsx` and
  gave it `flex:1;min-width:0;white-space:nowrap;overflow:hidden;text-overflow:ellipsis` in
  `halogrip.css` (plus `flex:none` on the sibling `<em>` concept-number badge so it never shrinks)
  — a too-long label now truncates with an ellipsis instead of ever being able to wrap.
- Verified via `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` (both clean, run twice) and live
  `getComputedStyle`/`offsetHeight` checks in the dev server confirming the new padding values
  are live and that all 5 concept-deck-card labels render at a single-line 18px `offsetHeight`.
  **Screenshot verification was not possible this round** — this session's automated browser tab
  returned a flat blank frame at every scroll position tried on `/work/halogrip`, matching the
  known WebGL-tab-capture issue already documented at length elsewhere in this file (this page's
  persistent React Three Fiber canvas breaks this particular browser extension's tab-capture, not
  a page bug) — confirmed by reproducing the same blank result at the very top of the page too,
  ruling out a scroll-position problem. A future session with working screenshots should do a
  visual before/after density check if this becomes load-bearing.

### Font-size tokens re-pinned to mason-wong.com's actual pixel numbers, not just consolidated (this session, follow-up)
- Immediately after the previous entry's token-consolidation pass (same session), Sylvia asked to go
  further: "我想要mason的字号数字套到我的case里" — don't just organize HALOGRIP's own sizes into named
  tokens, actually replace their *values* with the specific pixel numbers measured off mason-wong.com.
  Two real constraints surfaced and were resolved with her before editing (via a plan-mode
  `AskUserQuestion`/plan-file round): (1) mason's numbers are static px, not fluid — HALOGRIP's desktop
  rules lean on `clamp(min,vw,max)`; resolved by keeping every existing clamp's `min`/`vw` slope
  untouched and only replacing the `max` ceiling with mason's number, so large-screen sizing now
  genuinely matches mason while the 760px-breakpoint fluid scaling behavior is undisturbed. (2) mason
  never uses anything below 12px anywhere on either page it was inspected on (home or `/liverpoolfc`)
  — HALOGRIP's `--fs-label`/`--fs-caption`/`--fs-micro` were 10/9/8px. First proposed leaving those
  three untouched (mason has no equivalent to copy); Sylvia rejected that and said explicitly "我想所有
  字都12px以上的，和mason一样" (I want everything 12px or above, same as mason) — so all three now sit
  at 12px too, same as `--fs-body`. This is a real, visible change: every eyebrow/footer/index-
  number/caption on the page got noticeably bigger, confirmed intentional rather than incidental.
- New `:root` values in `halogrip.css` (only the token *values* changed, no selectors touched — every
  selector already referenced these tokens from the prior consolidation pass): `--fs-hero` max
  270→**167** (mason's own Liverpool-FC-page project-title size — same role, a case study's own H1),
  `--fs-display-1` 205→**158**, `--fs-display-2` 147→**120**, `--fs-display-3` 138→**86**, `--fs-title`
  90→**80** (mason's Liverpool-page section-heading size), `--fs-stat` 76→**74**, `--fs-heading-lg`
  58→**61**, `--fs-heading-sm` 38→**37** (mason's Liverpool-page "Mobile app" sub-heading, exact
  match), `--fs-card-title-lg` 29→**34**, `--fs-meta-stat` max 27→**25**, `--fs-card-title-sm`
  22→**24**; body tiers `--fs-body-lg` 12→**14** (mason's nav/label size), `--fs-body` 11→**12**
  (mason's paragraph size), and `--fs-label`/`--fs-caption`/`--fs-micro` all 10/9/8→**12** per above.
- Verified via `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` (both clean) and live `getComputedStyle` checks
  in the dev server (`.hero-heading h1`→167px, `.overview-copy h2`→80px, `.overview-copy>p`→14px,
  `.eyebrow`/`.research-findings article p`/`.footer-bottom`/`.final-specs small`→12px, confirming
  nothing on the page renders below 12px anymore) plus a screenshot of the hero section.

### HALOGRIP's type system swapped to Koulen + Roboto Mono (mason-wong.com's own font pairing), and its scattered font sizes consolidated into named tokens (this session)
- This followed a separate conversation where Sylvia asked to inspect the font system on
  https://www.mason-wong.com/ (and its `/liverpoolfc` case-study page) via live browser
  `getComputedStyle` inspection — confirmed that site's headings are all set in **Koulen**
  (Google Fonts, SIL OFL 1.1, free to use commercially) and its body/UI text in **Roboto Mono**
  (Google Fonts, Apache 2.0, free commercially); the site also uses a decorative Chinese
  calligraphy typeface (HanyiSentyFoundation — free for personal use only, commercial use needs
  a paid Hanyi license) and two minor accent faces (Pinyon Script, Albert Sans for bracket
  glyphs) that Sylvia explicitly asked to skip. Confirmed with Sylvia via `AskUserQuestion` before
  touching code that "套用大小" meant: swap the fonts, and reorganize HALOGRIP's own existing
  (already fluid/`clamp()`-based, already tuned across many earlier sessions per the entries
  below) font sizes into a named tier system — not overwrite them with mason-wong's literal
  pixel numbers, which belong to a completely different, much simpler page layout.
- **Font loading** (`app/work/halogrip/page.tsx`): added `Koulen` (`weight:["400"]` — it's a
  single-weight display face, so `font-weight:700` on headings synthesizes/faux-bolds in the
  browser, same as it would with any single-weight display font) and `Roboto_Mono`
  (`weight:["400","500","700"]`) via `next/font/google`, following the exact route-scoped
  pattern `scroll-intro.tsx` already established for Poppins — variables land on `<main
  id="top">` via `className`, never touching the root layout or `/`. The old self-hosted
  `@font-face` rules (Nimbus Sans Narrow, DejaVu Sans Mono) were deleted from `halogrip.css`;
  the actual font files stay on disk unused, per this project's convention for superseded
  assets.
- **A real scoping bug hit and fixed**: `--halogrip-display`/`--halogrip-mono` (the CSS custom
  properties next/font/google's `variable` option defines) only exist on `#top` and its
  descendants — but `halogrip.css`'s `--display`/`--mono` tokens, and `body`'s own
  `font-family`, live on `:root`/`body`, which are *ancestors* of `#top`. CSS custom properties
  only inherit downward, so `:root` referencing `var(--halogrip-display)` was invalid at that
  scope and silently fell through to the fallback stack (confirmed live: computed
  `font-family` was resolving to the browser's generic `ui-sans-serif`/`Courier New`, not
  Koulen/Roboto Mono, even though the variables themselves were correctly defined one level
  down). Fixed with a second rule, `#top{--display:var(--halogrip-display),...;--mono:
  var(--halogrip-mono),...;font-family:var(--mono)}`, added right after `:root` — since `#top`
  wraps 100% of this route's rendered markup, redeclaring both the tokens and the base
  `font-family` there (rather than on `body`, which sits one level too high to see the
  variables) is what actually gets every element on the page onto the new fonts. `:root`'s
  copies of `--display`/`--mono` were reduced to plain fallback stacks (`'Arial Narrow',
  sans-serif` / `'Courier New',monospace`) so they're never invalid, just unused once `#top`'s
  override applies.
- **Font-size consolidation**: added ~14 named tokens to `halogrip.css`'s `:root` — heading
  tiers `--fs-hero` (the H1 only) / `--fs-display-1/2/3` / `--fs-title` / `--fs-heading-lg/sm` /
  `--fs-card-title-lg/sm` / `--fs-stat` / `--fs-meta-stat`, and body tiers `--fs-body-lg` (12px)
  / `--fs-body` (11px) / `--fs-label` (10px) / `--fs-caption` (9px) / `--fs-micro` (8px) — then
  replaced essentially every hardcoded `font-size` in the file's *desktop* rules with the
  matching token. This is a **consolidation, not a redesign**: most selectors just got their
  existing exact value wrapped in a shared, named variable (e.g. every already-identical 9px
  caption across `journey-lede`/`story-grid article>p`/`interaction-footer`/etc. now reads
  `var(--fs-caption)`), and only genuinely-drifted near-duplicates were snapped together (e.g.
  the card-title cluster 20/22/24/29/31px collapsed to two tokens, `--fs-card-title-sm`(22)/
  `-lg`(29)). The `@media(max-width:760px)` block was **not touched** — it overrides the same
  selectors with its own fixed px values regardless of what the desktop rule resolves to, so it
  keeps working unchanged. `.need-*` (section 02.2's photo-overlay annotations, coordinate-matched
  pixel-for-pixel against a reference image per an earlier session's entry) was **deliberately
  excluded** from size consolidation — only its font-family changes via the shared token, its
  sizes are untouched, since nudging them risks misaligning text against the SVG leader-lines.
- **Letter-spacing cleanup**: removed the negative tracking (`-.01em` to `-.026em`) that every
  Koulen-driven heading selector had inherited from Nimbus Sans Narrow. Koulen is already a
  tightly-set condensed display face (confirmed against mason-wong.com's own CSS, which uses
  `letter-spacing:normal` throughout) and reads cramped with extra negative tracking on top.
- `design-gap-sequence.css` and `scroll-intro.css` need no direct edits — both already reference
  `var(--display)`/`var(--mono)` rather than hardcoding a font name, so they picked up
  Koulen/Roboto Mono automatically once the shared tokens changed. Updated two stale code
  comments in `scroll-intro.tsx`/`scroll-intro.css` that described Poppins as "a deliberate,
  scoped exception to this page's Nimbus Sans Narrow" to say Koulen instead — Poppins itself is
  untouched, still exclusive to `.scroll-intro`.
- Verified via `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` (both clean, run twice — once before the
  `#top` scoping fix, once after) and live `getComputedStyle` checks in the dev server across
  representative elements (`.hero-heading h1`, `.overview-copy h2`/`>p`, `.eyebrow`, `.research-
  findings h3`, `.wordmark`, `body`, `#top`) confirming Koulen/Roboto Mono actually resolve (not
  just that the token chain looks right on paper) — this is what caught the `#top`-scoping bug
  above, a plain visual screenshot would not have surfaced it since the fallback stacks
  (`ui-sans-serif`, `Courier New`) don't look obviously broken. Also confirmed visually via
  screenshots at the hero, `02.3 CURRENT RESPONSE`, `01 OVERVIEW`, and `03 PROBLEM STATEMENT`
  sections post-fix.

### Section 6 replaced: PROTOTYPE TESTING out, SKETCH PROCESS in — reusing a previously-shelved sketch-sheet asset (this session)
- Sylvia asked to put `public/media/halogrip图片/other/sketches.webp` (a wide hand-sketch summary
  sheet: 6 rounds of grip-form iteration converging on a pink-highlighted "Final" form) into the
  current section 6, replacing it entirely. This file was a previously shelved asset — an earlier
  session had deliberately dropped it from the page ("for now") while keeping it on disk for
  later; this session reactivates it. Confirmed three open questions with Sylvia via
  `AskUserQuestion` before touching code: (1) the old section 6 content is deleted outright, not
  relocated; (2) the new section uses a full-width layout, not the old section's 50/50 photo/copy
  split — this project has repeatedly hit "dense sketch sheet unreadable when squeezed into a
  half-width slot" (see the several 05-concept-carousel sizing rounds elsewhere in this file), so
  full width was the safe default for legibility; (3) yes, write a small amount of draft copy
  (eyebrow + one-line heading + a caption), flagged for her review rather than leaving the section
  bare.
- **Old section removed wholesale**: `.testing`/`#testing` — a two-column section with
  `prototype.webp` (physical foam-prototype photo) on the left and "TEST. LEARN. REFINE." +
  three evaluation findings (LOWER PIVOT / BIGGER CONTROLS / TWO-STEP ACCESS, the `iterations`
  array in `page.tsx`) on the right. That content described physical-prototype evaluation, a
  different story from sketch-stage form iteration, so it was deleted rather than kept or moved —
  per Sylvia's explicit call, not an assumption.
- **New `<section className="sketch-process section shell" id="sketch-process">`** in `page.tsx`:
  eyebrow `[ 06 / SKETCH PROCESS ]`, a draft `<h2>FROM WHEEL TO GRIP.</h2>` (own
  `// TODO(sylvia): draft heading` comment), then a `<figure>` with the sketch sheet at full
  section width (`width:100%;height:auto`, no `object-fit` crop — the whole point given this
  project's history of illegible cropped sketch sheets) and a draft `<figcaption>SIX ITERATION
  ROUNDS / FINAL FORM SELECTED</figcaption>` (own `TODO(sylvia)` comment). Both text strings are
  my drafts for Sylvia to confirm or replace, not treated as final copy.
- `halogrip.css`: replaced the old `.testing`/`.testing-photo`/`.testing-copy`/`.iteration-list`
  rule block (desktop + the `max-width:760px` override) with a much smaller `.sketch-process`/
  `.sketch-process-figure` block. Also removed `.testing-copy h2` from the shared oversized-title
  selector on the `.principles` line (that selector's other members — `.final-content h2`,
  `.journey-inner h2`, `.site-footer h2` — are unrelated hero-scale headings; the new section's
  `h2` uses its own smaller rule, sized like `.concept-heading h2` rather than a full-bleed hero
  headline) and dropped a now-dead `.iteration-list h3` from the `.principles-list h3,.story-grid
  h3` shared selector.
- No nav link pointed at `#testing`, so renaming the section id to `#sketch-process` was safe
  (confirmed by grep before renaming).
- Verified via `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` (both clean, run twice — once after the
  initial edit, again after the CSS dead-selector cleanup). **Browser screenshot verification hit
  the same known issue documented elsewhere in this file** (`document.hidden`/`visibilityState`
  reporting `"hidden"` for this session's automated tab — an environment characteristic, not a
  page bug) — screenshots came back blank even though the page was live. Verified instead via
  direct DOM/network checks: fetched the image URL directly (200, `image/webp`, natural size
  1920×1080 matching the source file), confirmed the rendered `<img>`'s on-page aspect ratio
  matches that natural ratio exactly (no distortion from the `height:auto` CSS), confirmed
  eyebrow/heading/caption text render as authored, and confirmed the new section's top/bottom
  edges land exactly on the previous section's (`#concepts`) bottom and the next section's
  (`#solution`, 07 FINAL CONCEPT) top with zero gap or overlap.

### 09 / EMERGENCY HANDOVER five-step scenario rebuilt from a supplied asset pack; new one-time section-fade-in helper added (this session)
- Sylvia supplied a zip, `public/media/halogrip图片/other/halogrip-scenario-assets-F3F2EE.zip`
  (5 storyboard frames — Authorize/Activate/Reposition/Park/Complete — plus a `README.txt`
  stating the canvas/background color is exactly `#F3F2EE` and that the 5 images already have
  that color composited into their own backgrounds, so the page should use
  `background-color:#F3F2EE` rather than loading the included reference PNG), with an explicit
  spec: use the 5 images in that order: set the section's entire background to `#F3F2EE`; no
  cards/shadows/borders/white containers around the images (their backgrounds already match);
  all 5 steps equal size/weight in one horizontal row; restrained red only on the step numbers
  and a thin connecting line; reuse the existing condensed heading/mono body fonts; a single
  subtle whole-section fade-in (8px upward, 600ms) with no per-step animation, no pinning, no
  scroll-progress linkage; stay responsive; don't touch any other section.
- Extracted the 5 PNGs to `public/media/halogrip图片/09-handover/` (own per-section folder, same
  convention as `03/`, `2.1`-`2.4`, `05-iteration/`). `#F3F2EE` is exactly this file's existing
  `--paper-light` token, so no new color was introduced — `.journey` (section 09's own class)
  now sets `background:var(--paper-light)`, matching how `.interaction` (section 08, just above
  it) already uses the same token.
- **`dark-section` removed from section 09.** It was previously a `<section className="journey
  dark-section">`; with `--paper-light` as the new background, keeping `dark-section` (`background
  :var(--dark);color:var(--white)`) would fight the new bg. Removing it lets every descendant fall
  back to `body`'s own `color:var(--ink)` for free — the only follow-up needed was recoloring a
  handful of colors that had been hand-picked light-gray-on-dark literals (`#c8cbc6`, `#c4c7c1`,
  `#555956`, etc., on `.journey-lede`, `.story-grid article>p`, `.access-detail>p`/`.hud-detail>p`,
  `.system-detail`'s border) over to the existing `var(--muted)`/`var(--line)` tokens.
- `steps` in `page.tsx` renamed to match the supplied filenames — `IDENTIFY`→`AUTHORIZE`,
  `RELEASE`→`COMPLETE` (`ACTIVATE`/`REPOSITION`/`PARK` unchanged) — each entry now also carries
  its asset's filename stem so the map can build the `/media/halogrip图片/09-handover/<file>.png`
  src directly. The old `story-N.webp` images (a different, non-matching asset set) are no longer
  referenced by this section; left on disk untouched, same as every other superseded-but-kept
  asset in this project's history.
- **Connecting line**: each step is `<img> → .story-step (number + line) → h3 → p`, where
  `.story-step` is a flex row of the red index number plus a `flex:1` 1px red line
  (`opacity:.35`) filling the rest of that step's own column width; the last step's line is
  `visibility:hidden` (nothing to connect to after it). This reads as one continuous line across
  the row at normal viewing sizes, with only the 16px grid gap between columns as an unbridged
  gap — a deliberate simplification over precisely bridging every grid gutter, in keeping with
  "restrained." `.story-grid article img` switched from `object-fit:cover` (with a `var(--paper)`
  crop fallback, no longer needed) to `object-fit:contain` at `aspect-ratio:1.618/1` (the 5 new
  PNGs' own real ratio, read directly from their PNG headers — 1.607–1.627 across the 5 files,
  close enough to treat as one shared ratio) — since the images' own backgrounds already match
  the section's, `contain` shows each frame in full with no visible letterboxing seam.
- **New `app/work/halogrip/section-reveal.tsx`** (`SectionReveal`, "use client"), a small generic
  wrapper — renders the `<section>` itself (not an extra nested `<div>`) — that fires a plain
  `IntersectionObserver` once, adds `is-visible`, then disconnects: no continuous scroll linkage,
  no per-child animation, matching the "don't animate individual steps / don't pin / don't
  connect to scroll progress" constraint exactly. `page.tsx`'s section 09 now renders
  `<SectionReveal id="handover" className="journey">` instead of a plain `<section>`. CSS
  (`halogrip.css`): `.section-reveal` defaults to `opacity:1` (so content already in the DOM
  without JS, or before the observer fires, is never stuck invisible); only once the component
  has mounted does it add a second class, `section-reveal-armed`, and only under `@media
  (prefers-reduced-motion:no-preference)` does `.section-reveal-armed` actually go to `opacity:0;
  translateY(8px)` with a `.6s` transition, with `.is-visible` bringing it back to
  `opacity:1;translateY(0)` — so reduced-motion visitors and no-JS visitors both just see the
  section, no animation, no flash of hidden content.
- Not wired into any other section — `SectionReveal` exists as a reusable helper now, but per
  the brief ("do not modify other sections") only section 09 uses it this session.
- Verified via `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` (both clean) and direct DOM/computed-style
  inspection in the dev server: `#handover`'s background resolves to `rgb(243,242,238)`
  (`#F3F2EE`); `.story-grid` lays out as 5 equal `204.97px` columns with the images loading `200`
  and rendering at the real `1.618/1` ratio; each step number and its connecting line compute to
  `rgb(201,55,49)` (`--red`), with the 5th step's line `visibility:hidden`; `.system-detail`'s
  recolored border/paragraph text resolve to the `--line`/`--muted` token values; and injecting
  the file's existing `@media(max-width:760px)` rules as a scratch override (this session's
  automated browser can't actually resize its viewport — same tooling limitation noted elsewhere
  in this file) confirms the grid collapses to 2 columns with the 5th step spanning full width.
  **Pixel screenshots of this page could not be used for verification this session** — every
  screenshot attempt (fresh load, after `_scrollTop()` jumps, after real incremental mouse-wheel
  scrolling, at section 09 and also at the untouched section 08 above it) came back a flat blank
  frame despite `getComputedStyle`/`elementFromPoint` on the same live tab confirming fully
  opaque, correctly colored, correctly positioned content at that exact moment — almost certainly
  the browser extension's tab-capture mechanism breaking against this page's persistent React
  Three Fiber/WebGL canvas (a known class of Chromium tab-capture bug), not a real rendering
  defect. Flagging in case a future session hits the same thing: don't trust a blank screenshot
  on `/work/halogrip` as evidence of a bug without cross-checking computed styles first.

### 05 / CONCEPT EXPLORATION deck — concept numbers made explicit after Sylvia flagged the "1 3 4 2" card order as confusing (this session, follow-up)
- Immediately after the previous entry's asset switch, Sylvia noticed the on-card labels' own
  ppt numbering ("1.", "3.", "4a.", "4b.", "2.") reads as a strange, non-sequential order when
  browsed in deck position order, and — more importantly — that landing on the final card never
  actually told a viewer *which* concept number they'd arrived at ("不过现在这个顺序 1 3 4 2 是
  不是有点奇怪，而且没有显示我最后选择了2" — isn't this 1/3/4/2 order a bit odd, and it doesn't
  show I ultimately picked [concept] 2). Both are the same root cause: the deck's position order
  (dictated by "selected direction must be the last card revealed," unchanged from every earlier
  round's spec) and the ppt's own concept numbering are two different sequences, and showing only
  the ppt number with no framing made the mismatch read as a mistake instead of two intentionally
  separate axes.
- Fix, `concept-carousel.tsx`: added a `conceptNumber` field to each `Concept`
  ("CONCEPT 01"/"03"/"04A"/"04B"/"02", the ppt's own numbering, unchanged) and stopped folding
  that number into `label` (label is now just the plain title — "Screen + External Device",
  "Pull-Out Wheel", etc.). Each on-sheet card now shows `CONCEPT NN` (red, `.concept-deck-card-
  label em`) next to the title on every card consistently, so the ppt numbering reads as its own
  labelled axis wherever a viewer is in the deck, distinct from the position counter (`01/05`
  etc.) already shown below. The final reveal's eyebrow changed from a bare "SELECTED DIRECTION"
  to "SELECTED DIRECTION — CONCEPT 02", directly answering "which concept did I land on."
  `halogrip.css`: `.concept-deck-card-label` is now `display:flex;gap:10px` to lay the number and
  title side by side; new `.concept-deck-card-label em{font-style:normal;color:var(--red)}` rule
  for the number.
- Verified via `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` (both clean) and a live dev-server check:
  read all 5 card labels (confirmed "CONCEPT 01" through "CONCEPT 04B" render on their respective
  cards) and clicked through to the last card, confirming the eyebrow reads exactly
  "SELECTED DIRECTION — CONCEPT 02".

### 05 / CONCEPT EXPLORATION sketch deck switched back to the slides 11-15 asset set — the illegibility was never a sizing problem (this session, follow-up)
- Mid-session Sylvia pointed straight at the fix: "你是不是不知道原稿的草图在哪里，在这里
  `public/media/halogrip图片/other`" (do you not know where the original sketches are? they're
  here). Opening the files in that folder (and the sibling `public/media/halogrip图片/05/`
  folder, which turned out to hold the same set at full size) showed the real problem: the
  `05-iteration/` sketches used since the previous "sketch deck" rebuild (extracted directly out
  of the pptx zip, slides 18-22) are raw, white-on-black scans — dense overlapping pencil
  strokes, handwritten pink annotations, and a lot of dead black canvas around a comparatively
  small drawing. No CSS card-size increase was ever going to fix that (three separate rounds of
  enlarging tried and failed) because the useful content was always a small fraction of each
  image's own bounds — enlarging the card just enlarged the dead space along with it.
  `public/media/halogrip图片/05/concept-*.{jpg,png}` — the slides 11-15 "Ideation - Concepts
  Exploration" set this same section used in its very first round, before later rebuilds drifted
  onto the 18-22 set per an earlier explicit instruction — turned out to already be clean,
  well-composed, black-on-white line art at the same 2048x1431 (1.431 ratio) size. Confirmed by
  opening all 5 files directly: no illegibility issue at all, just normal design-sketch density.
- **`concept-carousel.tsx`**: `CONCEPTS` now points at the 5 existing `05/concept-*` files
  instead of `05-iteration/sketch-*`: Screen + External Device, Detachable Steering Device,
  Touch Screen, HUD + Joystick, and Pull-Out Wheel last as the `selected` (SELECTED DIRECTION)
  card — same card order and same "final card = selected direction" narrative structure as
  before, only the underlying image set and per-card labels/alt text changed to match this
  content. The `05-iteration/` folder and its pptx-extracted images are left on disk, unused,
  same as every other superseded asset folder in this project's history — not deleted.
- **`halogrip.css`**: removed the `contrast(1.18) brightness(1.1)` filter on
  `.concept-deck-card img` — that was compensating for the old dark/muddy scans and has no
  purpose (and no real effect worth keeping) on the new clean white-background art.
- Verified via `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` (both clean), plus a live check in the dev
  server: `fetch()`'d all 5 new image paths (200, correct content-type, byte sizes matching the
  files read directly), then clicked through to the final card and confirmed
  `SELECTED DIRECTION` / `PULL-OUT WHEEL` renders with `concept-2-pullout-wheel.jpg` as the
  active image.

### 05 / CONCEPT EXPLORATION sketch deck sized up twice more after Sylvia reported the cards still illegible (this session, follow-up to the follow-up)
- Sylvia's report after the previous round's size bump ("48vh→68vh" stage, "44%→56%" card) was
  blunt: "草图都不对，全部都看不清晰为什么" (the sketches are all wrong, none can be seen
  clearly, why?), then mid-session, live: "图片还是太少，看不清楚" / "太小" (still too
  small/sparse, too small). The previous round's fix wasn't enough — this round drops the
  viewport-height cap entirely and sizes the deck primarily off the container width instead.
  `.concept-deck-stage` went from `width:min(100%,calc(68vh * 1.7))` to `width:min(100%,1040px)`;
  `.concept-deck-card` went from `44%` (Round 8's original) → `56%` (previous round) → `66%` of
  the stage (this round). At a typical ~960px-wide container the active card is now ~634px wide —
  roughly 2.8x its original size. Contrast/brightness filter on the sketch `<img>` bumped slightly
  further (`contrast(1.18) brightness(1.1)`, was `1.15/1.08`) and the card label font/padding grew
  a notch too. Mobile override (`@media(max-width:760px)`) updated to match:
  `.concept-deck-stage{width:100%}` (was `calc(52vh * 1.7)`), `.concept-deck-card{width:78%}`
  (was `66%`).
- The four background sketch sheets' `SLOT_STYLE` offsets in `concept-carousel.tsx` are
  percentage-based (`xPercent`/`yPercent`, self-relative to each card's own — now much bigger —
  box), so they scaled up proportionally with the active card automatically; no changes needed
  there, and a live geometry check (`getBoundingClientRect()` on the arrows and all 5 cards)
  confirmed no overlap with the arrow buttons at the new size.
- **Verification note — this session's browser automation was itself unreliable**: screenshots
  repeatedly came back solid blank even though `document.querySelector` confirmed all content
  (including the always-visible fixed `CLOSE PROJECT` pill) was correctly laid out and painted
  colors were set — traced to `document.hidden`/`visibilityState` reporting `"hidden"` for the
  automated tab (an OS/window-focus issue with the Chrome extension on this machine this session,
  not a page bug). Visual confirmation of the final size was therefore done via direct DOM
  geometry checks (`getBoundingClientRect` on the stage/cards/arrows, `img.naturalWidth` to
  confirm all 5 sketch assets decode correctly) rather than screenshots.
- **Also found and diagnosed, not a real bug**: mid-session, clicking through multiple concepts in
  quick succession sometimes left the GSAP-driven card transform/opacity visually frozen at an
  earlier index while React's own state (`aria-hidden`, the `01/05`-style counter, the `SELECTED
  DIRECTION` copy) had already correctly advanced further. Console logs showed repeated
  `[Fast Refresh] rebuilding` events landing in the same windows as the test clicks, and the
  system's own file-watcher reminders confirmed `halogrip.css` was being edited on disk by a
  concurrent process throughout this session — i.e. Next.js dev-mode Fast Refresh was remounting
  the component (resetting its GSAP mount baseline) mid-test because of unrelated concurrent
  edits, not because of a flaw in `concept-carousel.tsx`'s own logic. Confirmed clean: on a fresh
  page load with no concurrent edits in flight, a single click (and a verified 4-click sequence
  through to the final `SELECTED DIRECTION` / `PULL-OUT WHEEL` state, checked via
  `getComputedStyle().transform`/`.opacity` on all 5 cards) drives the GSAP transform to exactly
  the slot `slotFor(i, index)` predicts every time. No code change was made for this — flagging it
  here in case a future session sees the same symptom and wonders whether the carousel logic
  itself is broken; it isn't, verified by hand-deriving `slotFor()`'s expected output and matching
  it against the live DOM transform matrices.
- Verified via `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` (both clean).

### 05 / CONCEPT EXPLORATION replaced again — the click-gallery is out, a scattered "sketch deck" (five overlapping paper sheets) is in; assets switched to ppt slides 18-22's iteration sketches (this session, follow-up)
- Sylvia sent a real mockup she'd made herself,
  `public/media/halogrip图片/other/skets reference.png`, and asked for the section to match it:
  five overlapping paper-sheet cards (one large/sharp/centred, four smaller/faded/rotated behind
  it), switching only via left/right circular arrow buttons — no pagination boxes, no big
  "SELECTED" button (both explicitly asked to be removed) — with a bottom-left "SELECTED
  DIRECTION / PULL-OUT WHEEL" reveal on the last card. This is a layout/interaction reference,
  not literal content: it uses placeholder sketch names ("Pop-up yoke," "Sliding control
  handle") that don't exist in the project. The actual content came from a separate, explicit
  instruction — "use the real sketches from PPT pages 18-22" — which is a *different* slide
  range than every earlier round of this section (those all used slides 11-15's "Concepts
  Exploration" filmstrip).
- **Re-extracted the full pptx** (a previous partial extraction in the scratchpad only had
  slides 9 and 11-15 cached from earlier rounds) and read slides 18-22: four "iteration" sketches
  (ppt's own numbering, `Sketch 1-4`) each pairing a shape/mechanism/interaction choice — 1:
  D-shaped wheel + single pedal + mechanical pull-out + HUD; 2: U-shape yoke + on-screen +
  electrical insert; 3: oblique ellipse + NFC + aircraft-throttle-style speed control; 4: classic
  round + electrical slide rails + voice control — converging on slide 22's own "Final" sketch,
  whose on-slide handwritten text literally reads "Final = B pillar + Mechanical + HUD + U-shape
  + attached to dashboard": the pull-out wheel. That's a direct, ppt-sourced justification for
  the "5th card = selected direction" structure, not an assumption. Copied the 5 real images
  (`ppt/media/image23.png`/`24`/`25`/`26`/`28.jpg`) to
  `public/media/halogrip图片/05-iteration/sketch-{1-4}-*.png` +
  `sketch-5-final-pullout-wheel.jpg` — the previous round's `05/` folder assets (from slides
  11-15) are now unused but left on disk, same as every other superseded-but-kept asset folder in
  this project's history.
- **`app/work/halogrip/concept-carousel.tsx` rewritten again.** Click/keyboard-only (Left/Right
  arrow keys), exactly as before — nothing new added around scroll/wheel/drag. New per-card
  positioning model: each non-active concept is assigned one of four fixed background slots
  (upper-left/lower-left/upper-right/lower-right) by its position in the array *relative to
  whichever is currently active* (recomputed every index change via `slotFor()`), so the
  background cards visibly reshuffle into their new slots rather than jumping. GSAP tweens each
  card's `xPercent`/`yPercent`/`rotation`/`scale`/`opacity` to match. On the final card
  (`index===LAST`), every non-active card's target opacity is forced to `0` instead of its usual
  background-slot opacity — a full fade-out, not just a dim — matching "fade the other sketches
  out" from the brief.
- **A real centering bug found and fixed.** First pass set each card's *initial* position via a
  raw multi-function CSS `transform` string in a React inline `style` prop (`translate(...%, ...%
  ) rotate(...) scale(...)`), then handed the element to GSAP's `xPercent`/`yPercent` for
  subsequent tweens. Confirmed directly via `getBoundingClientRect()`: the "centre" slot
  (`xPercent:0, yPercent:0`, meant to be a no-op offset) rendered ~290px off from the stage's
  actual measured centre. Root cause: GSAP must parse and internally decompose whatever
  transform already exists on an element the first time it tweens it, and a multi-function
  string it didn't itself author doesn't decompose cleanly into the xPercent/yPercent baseline it
  expects. Fixed by never writing a raw CSS `transform` at all — an additional `useEffect(() =>
  {...}, [])` calls `gsap.set()` (not `gsap.to()`) once on mount to establish GSAP's own
  baseline for every card, before the index-driven effect's `gsap.to()` calls ever run on them.
  Re-verified after the fix: stage centre and the centred card's own centre matched to within
  rounding.
- Verified via `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` (clean) and dev-server interaction:
  confirmed the centred card sits precisely centred with symmetric background cards on both
  sides (not just visually — re-checked computed rects), clicked through all 5 sketches via the
  arrow buttons, confirmed the readout text/labels match each sketch's real ppt content, and
  confirmed the final click shows "SELECTED DIRECTION" (red) / "PULL-OUT WHEEL" with every other
  sketch faded to fully invisible, matching the supplied mockup.

### 05 / CONCEPT EXPLORATION gallery — sizing pass: frame and both headings shrunk (this session, follow-up)
- Sylvia's next look at the new click-controlled gallery (previous entry): "图片和字都太大了看不清"
  (the image and text are all too big, hard to see clearly). Two separate, real sizing problems,
  both fixed in `halogrip.css` only (no JS/structure changes):
  - **`.concept-gallery-frame`** was `width:100%;aspect-ratio:1.431` — at the shell's max width
    (~1530px inside the 1700px shell minus gutters) that resolves to a ~1069px-tall box, taller
    than most real browser viewports. The image was technically never cropped (per the previous
    round's fix) but practically couldn't be *seen* — its top and bottom didn't fit on screen at
    once, so seeing the whole sketch required scrolling within the section. Fixed by making
    height the driving dimension instead of width: `width:min(100%,calc(52vh * 1.431))` (pure
    CSS, no JS measurement) caps the frame at roughly 52% of viewport height — `aspect-ratio`
    then derives width from that capped height — while `min(100%, ...)` still lets width (and so
    height) shrink further on narrow viewports where 100% is the tighter constraint. Also added
    `margin-inline:auto` since the frame no longer reliably fills the shell's width.
  - **`.concept-heading h2`** (`page.tsx`'s "HOW SHOULD CONTROL APPEAR IN A VEHICLE DESIGNED
    WITHOUT IT?", part of the section's outer heading block above the gallery component, not
    the gallery itself) was `clamp(57px,7.4vw,98px)` — sized like the page's other big section
    headlines, but those are short punchy phrases ("LISTEN BEFORE DESIGNING.") while this one is
    a full question that wraps to 3 lines at that scale, eating a disproportionate amount of
    vertical space. Sylvia called this heading out by name in her feedback, so it's fair game
    despite being outside the gallery component proper. Reduced to `clamp(36px,4.4vw,58px)`
    (mobile override 54px→32px) — now wraps to 2 lines and reads proportionate to the content
    below it instead of dominating the section.
  - `.concept-gallery-copy h3` (the per-concept title, e.g. "PULL-OUT WHEEL") was also nudged
    down slightly, `clamp(22px,2.6vw,34px)` → `clamp(18px,1.8vw,26px)`, as part of the same pass.
- Verified via `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` (clean) and dev-server screenshots: the
  outer heading now wraps to 2 lines at a proportionate size, and the gallery frame (with its
  title/eyebrow) fits comfortably within a normal viewport with room to spare — no more
  scrolling within the section just to see one image top-to-bottom.

### 05 / CONCEPT EXPLORATION replaced entirely — scroll/wheel-driven carousel out, click-controlled gallery in (this session, follow-up)
- After three rounds of carousel fixes (see the two entries below this one), Sylvia's next
  message wasn't a tweak — it was a full pivot away from the whole interaction model, delivered
  as a complete, explicit spec (reproduced almost verbatim into the plan file this session, then
  implemented directly per her own "implement the change directly rather than describing it").
  Root complaint: **vertical page scroll should only ever move between page sections.** Every
  carousel version up to this point intercepted scroll/wheel input inside 05 itself (first as a
  `position:sticky` scroll-scrub, then as a wheel-capturing self-contained widget) — visitors
  couldn't scroll upward through it, pause on one image, or skip past it naturally. That's gone
  now: `concept-carousel.tsx` no longer reads scroll position, wheel deltas, or drag gestures at
  all. It's a plain click/keyboard-driven index (`useState`, changed only by clicking a
  selector/arrow or pressing Left/Right with the gallery focused) — nothing here can ever trap
  or hijack the page's own scroll.
- **Also reverses the dark full-bleed navy panel** from the previous two rounds (`#121B32`,
  `left:50%;margin-left:-50vw` breakout) back to the page's normal warm off-white background,
  sitting inline in the existing `.concepts.shell` padding like any other section content — no
  more dark theme, no more edge-to-edge bleed. `page.tsx`'s `[ 05 / CONCEPT EXPLORATION ]`
  eyebrow/heading/intro paragraph above the component were untouched throughout (never part of
  the carousel component itself).
- **Presentation order changed for storytelling**, asset identity did not: Screen + Pedal →
  Modular Device → Touchscreen → HUD + Joystick → **Pull-out Wheel last**, labeled `SELECTED`
  instead of `05` in the selector row. The Pull-out Wheel asset is still `concept-2-pullout-
  wheel.jpg` internally (`id:"pullout-wheel"`) — moving it to the end of the *display* order is
  not a relabel to "Concept 05." Titles reverted from round 3's full ppt sentences back to short
  editorial names ("Screen + Pedal", "Modular Device", etc., matching what Sylvia's own spec
  listed verbatim as the concept order) — this is a deliberate reuse of existing project wording,
  not new copy invented for this round.
- **Structure**: one `.concept-gallery-frame` (`aspect-ratio:1.431`, unchanged real ratio of all
  5 sketch assets, so the box never resizes and the page never jumps switching concepts) with all
  5 images stacked as absolutely-positioned layers from mount — only the active one is
  `opacity:1`, the rest sit at `0`. Rendering all 5 up front *is* the preload Sylvia's spec asked
  for (no flash switching, no separate `<link rel=preload>` needed). On index change, GSAP
  crossfades the outgoing layer out (`opacity:0,x:-10`) while the incoming one fades in from the
  opposite offset (`x:10→0,opacity:1`), ~250ms, `prefers-reduced-motion` skips the duration
  entirely — restrained, matches the spec's 220-300ms/8-12px numbers, no scale/3D/bounce.
- Below the image: 5 real `<button>` selectors (`01`/`02`/`03`/`04`/`SELECTED`) +
  Previous/Next arrow buttons (disabled at either end). The `SELECTED` selector is styled in
  `var(--red)` **unconditionally**, independent of `aria-pressed` — it reads as red from first
  paint (concept 1 is what's actually shown on load, per spec) so a visitor can identify and jump
  straight to the chosen direction without clicking through the other four; a separate
  `aria-pressed="true"` style (bordered/ink-colored) marks whichever is currently *being viewed*,
  so the two signals ("this is the selected direction" vs "this is what you're looking at right
  now") stay visually distinct and can coexist once you land on it.
- Clicking `SELECTED` swaps in the Pull-out Wheel image and switches the eyebrow from the plain
  `01`-style number to `SELECTED DIRECTION` (red) with the title reading `PULL-OUT WHEEL` — same
  crossfade as every other switch, no separate animation path, no dark treatment.
- Removed entirely, all now dead: the `wheel` event listener and its threshold/cooldown
  accumulator, the manual `pointerdown`/`pointermove`/`pointerup` drag tracking, the
  `ResizeObserver`-measured filmstrip geometry (`cardW`/`cardH`/`step`/`xFor`/`FOCUS_SCALE`), the
  background crossfade+tint+wash layers, the bottom progress rail, and — because this component
  no longer mounts an async, non-trivial-height section — the `gsap`/`ScrollTrigger` import and
  its `ScrollTrigger.refresh()` mount-effect workaround that every prior round of this component
  needed (documented in each of the entries below) to counteract the site's
  `normalizeScroll()` stale-max-scroll-bound bug. That bug was a symptom of async layout height
  changes interacting with page-scroll bounds; a component that never captures scroll and has a
  simple, CSS-fixed-aspect-ratio frame doesn't create the same failure mode, so the workaround
  is gone along with everything else that needed it.
- The old narrow-viewport (`<760px`) static-grid fallback (`ConceptFallback`) is also gone — that
  existed specifically because the old pin/scroll-scrub mechanic got fragile on narrow viewports;
  a click/tap-driven gallery has no such constraint, so the same component now serves every
  viewport width, and `.concept-gallery-selectors` just wraps via `flex-wrap` at narrow widths
  instead.
- CSS: the entire `.concept-carousel*` (dark full-bleed hero) and `.concept-fallback*` (static
  grid) blocks in `halogrip.css` were deleted and replaced with a new, much smaller
  `.concept-gallery*` block — deliberately renamed off "carousel" since the mechanic it now
  describes isn't a carousel at all.
- Verified via `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` (clean) and dev-server interaction: real
  mouse-wheel scrolling now passes straight through Section 05 in both directions with zero
  interception (confirmed scrolling up back into it, not just down past it); clicked every
  selector and the arrows; confirmed `SELECTED` reads red before ever being clicked; confirmed
  clicking it shows the `SELECTED DIRECTION` label + `PULL-OUT WHEEL` title with the ordinary
  crossfade only; confirmed Section 05 flows directly into the existing `06 / PROTOTYPE TESTING`
  content with nothing else on the page disturbed.

### 05 / CONCEPT EXPLORATION carousel — third round: cards no longer crop, copy replaced with the ppt's actual wording (this session, follow-up)
- Sylvia flagged two more things after seeing the second (wheel/drag/GSAP) rewrite: unfocused
  cards still felt "uncomfortable" because half of each was cropped away, and the copy on the
  carousel ("SCREEN + PEDAL" / "Screen control paired with a floor pedal — space-intensive." —
  carried over from the old static four-card grid, never actually sourced from the ppt) didn't
  match what the ppt itself says. Both fixed together, same files
  (`app/work/halogrip/concept-carousel.tsx`, `halogrip.css`), no plan-mode disagreement — just
  finished the ppt-fidelity work the earlier rounds hadn't gotten to yet.
- **No more cropping.** The half-height crop was inherited wholesale from the reference
  `HeroCarousel`'s own mechanic (`fullH`/`halfH`, shared top edge, `object-position` picking
  which half survives) — a deliberate choice *there* because it's built for portrait photography
  (cropping a portrait to its top half still reads as "a person"). Applied to landscape technical
  sketches, cropping to half just amputates the diagram. Replaced with: every card keeps the same
  fixed box at the sketches' real, uncropped ratio (`aspect-ratio:1.431`, unchanged from before),
  laid out at a constant `step` that never changes with focus — only the focused card's
  `transform:scale()` changes (`FOCUS_SCALE=1.38`, `transform-origin:50% 50%`, matching the
  centre-anchored growth already confirmed against the ppt's own coordinates in the previous
  round's entry). Because scale doesn't reflow the row, `xFor`/`step`/drag-snap math needed zero
  changes — only `.concept-carousel-card`'s box sizing and the per-card GSAP tween (now animating
  `scale`+`zIndex`+`boxShadow` instead of `height`) changed. `track`/`strip` switched from
  `align-items:flex-start` (needed for the old shared-top-edge crop) to `align-items:center`
  (matches the confirmed centre anchor). `gap` widened (`cardW*0.16` vs the old `*0.05`) so a
  scaled-up focused card has room before visually crowding its neighbours.
- **Copy now sourced from the ppt itself**, not the old grid's paraphrase. Re-read
  `ppt/slides/slide11-15.xml`'s body text and each sketch's own handwritten title bar (already
  extracted once, in an earlier round's changelog entry) and built the new `STAGES` fields
  directly from that: `conceptLabel` is the ppt's own numbering (`CONCEPT 01`../`03`, then
  `4A`/`4B` — not sequential 04/05, that's a deliberate mismatch: the position rail below still
  counts 01-05 sequentially through the 5 *cards*, while the headline's `conceptLabel` reports
  the ppt's own concept numbering, which two of the five cards share); `title` is each slide's
  body text verbatim (4a and 4b render the *identical* sentence, "Decision-making based steering
  device" — that's not a copy-paste bug, the ppt genuinely repeats it); `variant` (new field,
  `.concept-carousel-variant`, shown only on 4a/4b) is the one place the ppt actually distinguishes
  the two in words — each sketch's own title-bar text, "Touch Screen" / "HUD + Joystick". The old
  invented one-line justifications ("space-intensive," "potential misuse," "higher mental load" —
  never in the ppt, carried over from the pre-rebuild static grid) are gone entirely rather than
  kept alongside the real copy. "SELECTED DIRECTION" on Concept 02 was left alone — real site
  content about which direction was chosen, not a ppt-fidelity question.
- Verified via `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` (clean) and stepping through all 5 cards in
  the dev server (arrow keys + click): every neighbour card now shows its complete sketch at
  reduced size, the focused card is visibly larger without any crop boundary, and each card's
  headline text (checked directly against the table in the previous round's own changelog entry)
  matches — confirmed on-screen for Concept 01, 02 (tag renders cleanly beside the wrapped
  two-line title), and 4B (variant line "HUD + JOYSTICK" renders under the shared 4a/4b title).

### 05 / CONCEPT EXPLORATION rebuilt as a scroll-scrubbed filmstrip carousel, ported from `public/media/halogrip ppt.pptx` slides 11-15; `sketches.webp` hidden but kept on disk (this session)
- Sylvia asked to replace the static 4-card `.concept-grid` with "the animation" from pptx
  slides 11-15 ("Ideation - Concepts Exploration") — a Morph-transition sequence where each of
  5 slides enlarges a different one of 5 sketch cards into a "spotlight" while the rest sit in a
  row behind it. Ground truth pulled from the OOXML (`ppt/slides/slide11-15.xml`'s `<p:pic>`
  `<a:off>`/`<a:ext>` values, confirmed `<p159:morph option="byObject">` on all 5) — see the note
  below on why the literal per-slide EMU coordinates weren't ported 1:1.
- Also asked to drop the `sketch-sheet` full sheet image (`sketches.webp`, the large hand-drawn
  overview shown above the old grid) "for now" but keep the file on disk for later — removed only
  the `<img className="sketch-sheet">` JSX line and its now-dead CSS (`.sketch-sheet` rule, both
  desktop and the `max-width:760px` override); the file itself was left untouched in
  `public/media/halogrip图片/other/`.
- **New assets**: the pptx's own 5 sketch images (`ppt/media/image15-19.{jpg,png}`) were extracted
  and copied to `public/media/halogrip图片/05/concept-{1-screen-pedal,2-pullout-wheel,
  3-modular-device,4a-touchscreen,4b-hud-joystick}.{jpg,png}` — real filenames/captions read
  directly off each sketch's own handwritten title ("① Screen + External Device", "2. Steering
  wheel + Pull out + Functions", "Concept 3 Detachable Steering Device", "4a. L4-L2 Touch
  Screen", "4b. L4-L2 HUD + Joystick"). This incidentally corrected a pre-existing mismatch: the
  old `.concept-grid`'s `concept-screen.webp` (labeled "SCREEN + PEDAL" on the card) was actually
  a crop of the "4a Touch Screen" decision-UI sketch, not a screen-and-pedal concept — confirmed
  by opening the file directly. Not flagged further since this rebuild replaces that whole grid.
- **New `app/work/halogrip/concept-carousel.tsx`** (`ConceptCarousel`, "use client") + matching
  CSS in `halogrip.css` (`.concept-carousel*`, `.concept-fallback*`). What was ported from the
  pptx is the animation's *grammar* — a row of cards drifting horizontally, continuous scale/
  elevation falloff by distance from a fixed focus point, a connecting line with a filled
  progress bar and per-stage dots, and a title/description readout synced to whichever card is
  in focus — not the literal per-slide pixel coordinates: those aren't even self-consistent
  slide-to-slide (the enlarge target's on-slide x position was hand-placed per slide by whoever
  built the deck, not formulaic — verified by extracting and diffing all 5 slides' coordinates
  before deciding this). Implementation: a tall (`(STAGES.length-1)*90+100`vh) container with a
  `position:sticky` inner stage (mirrors `ScrollZoomImage.tsx`'s entry-progress technique, not
  GSAP `ScrollTrigger.create({pin:true})` — deliberate, see below); scroll progress drives a
  continuous `focus` value (0..4) via `-container.getBoundingClientRect().top / (containerHeight
  - stageHeight)`; each card's scale/lift/opacity/z-index/shadow is a distance-from-focus falloff
  written directly to refs per frame (no React state on the scroll path, matching
  `design-gap-scene.tsx`'s established pattern); the nearest integer stage drives the text
  readout via `setState` (only changes 4 times per full scroll, cheap). Kept "PULL-OUT WHEEL" as
  the previously-`concept-selected` entry, now surfaced as a `SELECTED DIRECTION` tag next to its
  title in the readout — see the outline bug note below for why it isn't a border on the card.
- **A real bug hit and fixed during this build**: the site's global GSAP
  `ScrollTrigger.normalizeScroll()` setup (the same mechanism behind `window._scrollTop()`,
  documented elsewhere in this file) caches a max-scroll bound. This component's own tall
  container doesn't exist in the DOM until after the `enhanced` check's first render pass, so
  without a nudge the page becomes unscrollable past whatever bound was cached before this
  component mounted — confirmed directly: `window._scrollTop(x)` would echo back `x` from its
  getter while the page's *real* `window.scrollY` silently stayed capped at the old, shorter
  bound. Fixed with one `ScrollTrigger.refresh()` call inside this component's mount effect.
  This is a different code path from the pin-timing bug `./pin-coordinator.ts` documents (that
  one is about an existing *trigger's own* `start`/`end` not responding to `refresh()` — this is
  normalizeScroll's separate max-scroll-bound cache, which does respond to `refresh()`). No
  `pin-coordinator` wiring was added for this component since it creates no GSAP pin of its own.
- **Bug found and fixed mid-build**: the "selected" concept was first marked with a persistent
  red `outline` directly on its card. Because adjacent cards overlap (card width 24% > the 21%
  step spacing, an intentional filmstrip stacking look) and z-index is focus-driven, the outline
  from the selected card could visually bleed out from behind whichever *other* card currently
  had focus and a higher z-index — reads as "the wrong concept is marked selected." Fixed by
  moving the "selected" signal off the card image entirely and into the text readout instead (an
  `<em class="concept-carousel-tag">SELECTED DIRECTION</em>` next to the active title) — no
  per-card outline at all now, so there's nothing for the stacking to expose incorrectly.
- Reduced-motion / narrow-viewport fallback (`ConceptFallback`, same `canEnhance()` pattern as
  `design-gap-scene.tsx`/`scroll-intro.tsx`): a plain static grid of all 5 stages, no scroll
  scrubbing, reusing the same `STAGES` data and the same `SELECTED DIRECTION` tag treatment.
- Verified via `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` (both clean) and dev-server screenshots
  stepping through 4 of the 5 stages (Screen+Pedal → Pull-out Wheel, tag confirmed showing
  cleanly with no stray outline → Modular Device → Decision UI/touchscreen), each showing the
  correct spotlight card, correct line-fill percentage, correct highlighted dot, and correct
  synced readout text; confirmed the page still scrolls normally into the sections below (09 /
  EMERGENCY HANDOVER rendered correctly after scrolling past this one). The 5th stage (Decision
  UI/HUD+joystick, `STAGES[4]`) was not independently screenshotted — it runs through the
  identical code path as the other 4 confirmed stages, just a different array index, and repeated
  large `window._scrollTop()` jumps in this session's automated browser became increasingly
  unreliable deep into this component's own tall scroll range (real `window.scrollY` intermittently
  drifted backward after being set, unrelated to any per-frame logic in this component — plausibly
  GSAP's own resize-triggered auto-refresh cascading against this page's several other pinned
  ScrollTriggers while lazily-loaded card images settled). Confirmed this is an automation-harness
  characteristic, not a page bug, by reloading fresh and reaching well past this section (scrollY
  21600 of ~23760 max, 09 / EMERGENCY HANDOVER rendering correctly) using many small incremental
  jumps instead of a few large ones. A future session should re-confirm stage 5 specifically with
  real mouse-wheel scrolling if this becomes load-bearing.

### 05 / CONCEPT EXPLORATION carousel rewritten a second time — self-contained wheel/drag/click hero, ported from a reference `HeroCarousel` component (this session, follow-up)
- The scroll-scrubbed version documented in the entry below this one shipped with three real
  problems Sylvia found by actually looking at it: the cards read as too narrow to make out the
  sketch detail, the background didn't match the ppt's dark navy slide, and the motion itself
  ("动线") was wrong. Diagnosed by re-reading the ppt's own OOXML coordinates directly against
  the shipped CSS/JS rather than guessing:
  - **Narrow cards**: `.concept-carousel-card{width:24%;height:100%}` combined two unrelated
    percentages into whatever aspect ratio fell out, which didn't match the sketches' real
    1.431:1 ratio (verified: both card sizes in the ppt, 2245800x1569300 and 2831100x1978200
    EMU, reduce to the exact same 1.431 — not a coincidence, it's the sketches' own aspect).
    Mismatched ratio meant `object-fit:cover` was cropping the sides off, including the
    handwritten labels near the edges of several sketches.
  - **transform-origin bug, confirmed from the ppt's own numbers**: computing each spotlight
    card's vertical centre (`y-offset + height/2`) across all 5 slides gives exactly 1811825
    EMU every time — identical to the same slide's un-enlarged row's own vertical centre. The
    ppt scales its spotlight card from the *centre*, not the bottom; the shipped code used
    `transform-origin:50% 100%` (bottom-anchored), which read as the card bulging upward when
    it grew instead of growing evenly.
  - **The real "动线" bug**: `track` translated by `-focus*STEP%` while each card sat at its own
    static `left:i*STEP%`, which nets out to the focused card always rendering at track x=0 —
    i.e. pinned to the stage's left edge on every single stage, not just some of them. Enlarging
    a card anchored at the left edge pushed its left half past the stage boundary into the
    `overflow:hidden` clip.
- Sylvia then supplied the actual fix in the form of a reference `HeroCarousel` component
  (framer-motion, full source pasted in-conversation, not just a usage demo) and said to base
  the carousel's motion on it directly. Confirmed with her before touching code: rebuild using
  GSAP instead of adding framer-motion as a new dependency (this route uses GSAP exclusively —
  `scroll-intro.tsx`/`process-scene.tsx`/`design-gap-scene.tsx` — and hand-written CSS, no
  Tailwind, unlike the reference's Tailwind+`cn()` markup), porting the reference's actual
  interaction model rather than literally its code.
- **`app/work/halogrip/concept-carousel.tsx` rewritten from scratch**, dropping the entire
  scroll-scrubbed architecture (the tall `position:sticky` spacer container, the
  `IntersectionObserver`+`window.scroll` progress listener, the continuous-float `applyFrame`).
  It's no longer tied to page-scroll position at all — matching the reference, it's a
  self-contained widget:
  - `index` is a discrete integer (`useState`), stepped by wheel, drag, a clicked card, or
    arrow/Home/End keys — never a continuous scroll-driven float
  - **The actual fix for the "动线" bug**: `xFor(i) = stageWidth/2 - (i*step + cardW/2)` — the
    *track* translates on every index change (via `gsap.to()`) so the focused card is always
    centred in the stage, with room on both sides. This is the reference's core trick and
    directly replaces the old "focus pinned at track origin" bug above.
  - Card sizing keeps the reference's "fixed height, width = height x aspect ratio, focused =
    full height, others = half height, shared top edge" framework unchanged — the ratio-agnostic
    part of it — with only `CARD_AR` swapped from the reference's 0.75 (portrait photography) to
    `1.431` (the sketches' real, ppt-verified ratio, confirmed above)
  - Wheel handling (accumulate delta into ±1 steps past a threshold, with a cooldown) is ported
    with the reference's own numbers (`WHEEL_THRESHOLD=60`, `WHEEL_COOLDOWN=420`), including its
    scroll-chaining behavior: at either end, wheel events aren't `preventDefault`'d, so hovering
    this full-bleed block and continuing to scroll hands the gesture back to the page instead of
    trapping it
  - Drag: no framer-motion `drag` prop available, so this is manual `pointerdown`/`pointermove`/
    `pointerup` tracking, live-writing the track's `x` via `gsap.set` during the drag and
    snapping to the nearest card on release (`Math.round((stageW/2 - thrown - cardW/2)/step)`,
    thrown = release position + a velocity nudge — same formula as the reference)
  - Background: all 5 sketches stacked as permanently-mounted absolutely-positioned layers,
    crossfaded via `gsap.to(el,{opacity})` on index change (simpler than the reference's
    `AnimatePresence` mount/unmount — GSAP has no equivalent primitive, so this trades a little
    always-loaded memory for not needing one). A single `#121B32` (the ppt's own navy) tint
    layer sits on top via `mix-blend-mode:multiply` — deliberately *not* per-card accent hues
    like the reference (Sylvia asked for one consistent dark navy background, not a different
    colour per concept)
  - Bottom-left rail (`01/05` counter + a sliding fill line) replaces the previous 5-dot
    indicator — closer to the reference's own rail treatment
  - `ResizeObserver`-driven measurement (not `window.innerWidth` breakpoints) means the whole
    thing scales continuously with real measured stage size, the same technique the reference
    uses — no separate `<760px` layout path needed
- **`.concept-carousel` is now a genuine full-bleed panel** (`left:50%;margin-left:-50vw` etc.,
  breaking out of the parent `.concepts.shell`'s max-width/padding), a deliberate default: the
  `[ 05 / CONCEPT EXPLORATION ]` eyebrow + big headline + intro paragraph *above* it stay on the
  page's normal light background, unchanged — only the carousel itself becomes the dark,
  ppt-navy, edge-to-edge "hero" panel, matching how `.need-scene`/`.response-scene`/
  `.design-gap-scene` already nest full-bleed dark scenes inside an otherwise-light page rather
  than converting a whole numbered section to dark. Flagged to Sylvia as the default interpretation
  in case she actually wants the outer heading dark too.
- **`canEnhance()` simplified** to only check `prefers-reduced-motion` — the old `<760px` check
  was there because a `position:sticky`+`ScrollTrigger`-scrubbed layout genuinely got fragile on
  narrow viewports; wheel/drag/click/keyboard input has no such constraint, so the interactive
  carousel now runs at any width and only the static `ConceptFallback` grid is reserved for
  actual reduced-motion preference (also re-themed dark, to match).
- **Hit the same normalizeScroll stale-max-scroll-bound issue as the previous version**, even
  though this rewrite creates no `ScrollTrigger` of its own: the component still mounts `null`
  on first paint then a real ~520-760px section once `enhanced` resolves, and that async height
  change is enough to desync the site's cached scroll bound again. Same fix, `ScrollTrigger
  .refresh()` in the mount effect — kept the `gsap`/`ScrollTrigger` import for exactly this one
  call, nothing else in the rewrite touches ScrollTrigger.
- Verified via `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` (both clean) and real interactive testing
  in the dev server (mouse wheel over the carousel to step through, click-any-card, `Home`/
  `ArrowRight` keyboard nav) — confirmed: focused card always centred with visible margin on
  both sides (no more left-edge clipping), sketches render at full legible size uncropped when
  focused, background is the dark navy from the ppt with a crossfade on every index change, the
  "SELECTED DIRECTION" tag reads clearly on the dark background next to PULL-OUT WHEEL, and
  wheel-scrolling past the last card correctly hands off to real page scroll (confirmed: scrolling
  past index 5 lands cleanly on `[ 06 / PROTOTYPE TESTING ]`, not stuck).

### 04 / DESIGN PRINCIPLES — heading downsized, intro image removed (this session, follow-up)
- Sylvia asked to shrink "第四section的大字" (04's big heading) and drop "那个图片" (the
  `product-detail.webp` close-up shot sitting under the intro paragraph in `.principles-intro`).
  `page.tsx`: removed the `<img>` line entirely (no `TODO(sylvia)` — an explicit removal request,
  not a missing asset). `halogrip.css`: `.principles-intro h2` was sharing one selector with
  `.final-content h2`/`.journey-inner h2`/`.site-footer h2`/`.testing-copy h2` at
  `font-size:clamp(73px,9vw,127px)` — split it into its own rule at `clamp(52px,6vw,92px)` so the
  other four headings (which weren't mentioned) stay untouched. Removed the now-dead
  `.principles-intro>img` rule (desktop) and its `max-width:760px` mobile override (was
  `width:95%;margin-top:36px`), and shrank the mobile `.principles-intro h2` override from `77px`
  to `54px` to match the new desktop scale down.
- Verified via `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` (both clean) and a dev-server screenshot at
  `#principles`: heading is visibly smaller, the image is gone, and the paragraph now sits with
  clean whitespace above the principles list instead of a photo.

### 03 / FIELD RESEARCH rebuilt as PROBLEM STATEMENT — content sourced from `public/media/halogrip ppt.pptx` slide 9 (this session)
- Sylvia asked to replace the top-level chapter 03 section (`id="research"` in `page.tsx` —
  distinct from the `02.x` THE CHALLENGE subsections; confirmed which one she meant via
  `AskUserQuestion` before touching anything, since both are plausible readings of "第三章节")
  with the content from page 9 of `public/media/halogrip ppt.pptx`, titled "PROBLEM STATEMENT -
  USER STUDIES". That slide's ground truth was read straight out of its OOXML (unzip the pptx;
  `ppt/slides/slide9.xml`'s `<a:t>` runs) and its speaker notes (`ppt/notesSlides/notesSlide9
  .xml`), not just the on-slide labels — the notes are what actually explain each of the 4 navy
  finding-box headers (OVERALL CONCERN ABOUT ROBOTAXI / CONTROL OVER VEHICLE BEHAVIOR /
  INSUFFICIENT STRATEGIES / STANDARDIZATION).
- The slide's own real photo (`ppt/media/image13.png`, a firefighter rope-rescue on an aerial
  ladder platform) was extracted and copied to `public/media/halogrip图片/03/firefighter-rescue
  .png`, following the same per-section-folder convention as `2.1`-`2.4`.
- Old section (a 3-image `.research-gallery` grid — fire/prototype/city photos, no connection to
  the actual field-research findings, just generic scene-setting) fully removed: `page.tsx`'s
  `research` section JSX rewritten, `.research-gallery`/`.research-fire`/`.research-prototype`/
  `.research-city` CSS deleted (desktop + the `max-width:760px` mobile block) and replaced with
  `.research-layout` (photo left, findings list right) + `.research-findings article` (a red
  index number + red uppercase meta line + body copy, deliberately reusing the same visual
  grammar as `.principles-list article` just below it in the page, rather than porting the PPT's
  own navy-box styling verbatim — per Hard Rule 1, the reference's content/structure was ported,
  its Google-Slides visual identity was not). Eyebrow renamed `[ 03 / PROBLEM STATEMENT ]` (was
  `[ 03 / FIELD RESEARCH ]`); `h2` copy ("LISTEN BEFORE DESIGNING.") and the closing
  `research-bottom` stats/quote block (04 firefighter interviews / 02 fire stations / 76 survey
  responses, the "FIVE TO TEN MINUTES ALREADY FEELS LONG" quote) were kept as-is — real validated
  research data, not something the PPT slide's own content should displace.
- The 4 finding bodies are original summaries of the notes' actual explanatory text (not just the
  slide's short label + sub-label fragments), written in the site's existing short-declarative
  voice — not flagged `TODO(sylvia)` since it's a faithful compression of her own PPT content, not
  invented placeholder copy.
- Verified via `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` (both clean) and dev-server screenshots at
  both the default ~1568px-wide automation viewport and a single-column mobile check. Same
  `resize_window`-doesn't-actually-resize tooling limitation noted elsewhere in this file applied
  again here — the mobile `.research-layout{grid-template-columns:1fr}` collapse was verified by
  injecting the new mobile-breakpoint rule as a scratch `!important` override at the current
  viewport and confirming the photo/findings stack vertically, then removing it, rather than a
  real narrow-viewport screenshot. Also hit (and worked around) a scroll-position issue while
  testing: this page's GSAP `ScrollTrigger.normalizeScroll()`-style setup intercepts native
  `window.scrollTo` during the pinned scroll-intro — it silently no-ops past a certain point — so
  jumping to a specific section for screenshot purposes requires calling the page's own
  `window._scrollTop(value)` (a getter/setter GSAP installs on `window`) instead of
  `window.scrollTo`.

### 02.3 CURRENT RESPONSE rebuilt as a single cinematic scene image, replacing the flat-card timeline; pin-timing bug fixed with a dependency-ordered coordinator (this session)
- **Content/visual rebuild.** `process-scene.tsx` was fully rewritten. The previous
  implementation (a flat DOM timeline: small glass-panel cards, an SVG process path, a grid
  background, a bottom DETECTED/CONNECTED/VERIFIED progress bar, a vehicle-stalled icon — see
  the "02.3 CURRENT RESPONSE — pinned scroll-driven process diagram" entry further below for how
  that version was built) was deleted outright, all matching `.process-*` CSS removed from
  `halogrip.css` (desktop + mobile), and replaced with: one full-viewport scene image
  (`public/media/halogrip图片/2.3/2.3-scene-clean.png` — moved here from a misplaced `2.4/`
  location; it already contains the first responder, glass process panels, red response path and
  robotaxi baked in as a single photo, so none of that is rebuilt in HTML/CSS/SVG anymore), a
  readability gradient, and real HTML label/headline/paragraph. Section label renamed
  `[ 02.3 / CURRENT RESPONSE ]` (was `CURRENT SOLUTION`) per Sylvia's explicit instruction — do
  not rename it back.
- Motion is now minimal by design: image opacity 0→1 + scale 1.025→1 on scroll-into-view (once,
  `toggleActions:"play none none none"`, not scrubbed), a small always-on horizontal parallax
  (Β±6px, scrubbed, disabled below 760px), and a short fade-up stagger on the label/headline/
  paragraph. No canvas, no per-node reveal choreography, no line-drawing animation — 02.4 is
  where the major transformation animation lives, 02.3 is deliberately a calm establishing shot.
- **Known geometric tension, resolved via the gradient, not fully eliminated:** the source
  image's first glass panel sits close to the left edge (~13% of the image's own width), and the
  spec'd headline/copy footprint (large condensed type, ~520-540px column) is wide/tall enough
  that on short viewports the headline can visually reach the panel's position. Confirmed
  directly (Sylvia flagged it live: "字好像有点挡后面背景的字"). Fixed by biasing
  `object-position` toward the image's left edge (`.response-scene-image`, more of the panel's
  clearance is preserved) and switching the readability gradient from a shallow linear fade to a
  strong `radial-gradient` anchored near the upper-left (`.response-scene-gradient`, 96%→0%
  opacity, anchor `6% 12%`) so the panel underneath is genuinely subdued rather than competing
  with the text, plus a tightened line-height (`.9`, still inside the spec's 0.9-0.95 range) and
  text-shadow on the paragraph. This was verified as a real improvement (panel text goes from
  clearly legible to a barely-visible ghost) but **not fully verified at the three target widths
  (1280/1440/1920)** — this session's automated browser has a fixed, non-resizable ~639px-tall
  viewport (`resize_window` calls report success but don't change `window.innerHeight`), which is
  a much wider/shorter aspect (2.0-3.0) than any real monitor at those widths (1280x800/1440x900/
  1920x1080 are all ~1.6-1.78). The `object-fit:cover` math was worked through by hand for those
  three real aspect ratios and gives meaningfully more clearance than what's visible in this
  session's own test screenshots; a future session with real viewport-resize should re-check
  before trusting this fully solved rather than just improved.
- **Pin-timing bug found and fixed** (this was the actual root cause of a report that read at
  first like "02.3 shows up twice with a blank gap in between" — right after the opening 3D
  model, then correctly again after 02.2): `process-scene.tsx` (and `overview-backdrop.tsx`)
  used to create their GSAP `ScrollTrigger`s synchronously on first mount, before `scroll-intro
  .tsx`'s own real pin (which is itself deferred to a second, hydration-safe render pass, and
  under real page load — heavy JS payload, WebGL setup — has been measured taking up to ~1s, not
  one frame) existed. That bakes in a `start`/`end` measured against a document that's still
  short. Calling `ScrollTrigger.refresh()` afterward does **not** fix an already-created trigger
  — verified directly from the browser console: a trigger's start/end survive `refresh()`
  unchanged no matter when it's called, while creating a brand-new trigger at that same later
  moment measures correctly on the first try. **New `app/work/halogrip/pin-coordinator.ts`**
  (replaces `scroll-refresh.tsx` below, which is now deleted — that file's refresh-after-the-fact
  approach was the first fix attempt and didn't work) is the real fix: `markPinReady(source)` /
  `onPinsReady(deps, callback)`, a small dependency graph so each section defers its own
  `ScrollTrigger` creation until everything above it has already landed. Wiring: `scroll-intro`
  has no deps; `process-scene` and `overview-backdrop` depend on `["scroll-intro"]`;
  `design-gap-scene` depends on `["scroll-intro","process-scene"]` (comes right after 02.3 in the
  DOM). `process-scene.tsx` also calls `markPinReady("process-scene")` essentially immediately
  (it has no pin/spacer of its own anymore, so nothing needs to wait on *it* for layout reasons —
  reported early purely so `design-gap-scene.tsx`'s own dependency resolves promptly instead of
  falling back to the coordinator's 4s safety timeout). Verified against a production build
  (`next build && next start`) with real mouse-wheel scrolling: 02.3 now pins/reveals exactly
  once, only after 02.2, no early appearance, no blank gap.
- If a future session touches `scroll-intro.tsx` or `design-gap-scene.tsx`'s own `enhanced`-flip
  gating, remember both must keep calling `markPinReady` on **every** code path (including the
  "decided not to enhance" branches) or a sibling waiting via `onPinsReady` will silently stall
  until the 4s timeout.

### 02.4 DESIGN GAP rebuilt as a bespoke pinned scroll transition; new ScrollRefresh helper added (outside this session, documented now)
- **Superseded**: the `ScrollRefresh` component described below (including its un-removed
  `TEMP-DIAGNOSTIC` flag) has been deleted and replaced by `pin-coordinator.ts` — see the entry
  above this one. Its refresh-after-creation approach didn't actually fix the stale-trigger bug
  it was written for. Also, this entry's description of `process-scene.tsx`'s six-step node-card
  content is now stale — 02.3 was rebuilt as a single scene image (see the entry above).
- `page.tsx`'s 02.4 section — previously the plain `PlaceholderImage`-based scaffolding from the
  "THE CHALLENGE (02) split..." entry further below — was replaced with `<DesignGapScene />`
  (`app/work/halogrip/design-gap-scene.tsx` + `design-gap-scene.css`, new files, not built in this
  session; documenting now so the structure reference stays accurate). `PlaceholderImage` is no
  longer imported anywhere in `page.tsx` — all four THE CHALLENGE subsections (02.1-02.4) now have
  real bespoke content; the placeholder-scaffolding phase is fully superseded.
- `DesignGapScene` is a pinned, scroll-driven GSAP/ScrollTrigger sequence (`pin:true, end:"+=250%"`,
  same pin/scrub pattern as `scroll-intro.tsx`) that visually compresses `process-scene.tsx`'s
  (02.3) six-step external-dependency chain (INCIDENT → CONTACT OPERATOR → VERIFY → REMOTE
  AUTHORIZATION / ON-SITE DISPATCH → MOVE OR TOW) into a single "local control" line (FIRST
  RESPONDER → LOCAL CONTROL → MOVE → ROBOTAXI) — same panel ids/titles/meta copy and icon set as
  02.3, by design, so it reads as compressing that specific diagram rather than inventing a new
  one. Real assets: `public/media/halogrip图片/2.4/assets/{design-gap-background,first-responder,
  robotaxi}.png` (verified present). Company names/invented timestamps are deliberately excluded,
  same reasoning as `process-scene.tsx`.
- Has its own reduced-motion/narrow-viewport fallback (`DesignGapFallback`, mirrors
  `scroll-intro.tsx`'s `canEnhance()` pattern — `prefers-reduced-motion` or `<760px` viewport skips
  the pin+scrub and renders a static two-column "EXTERNAL DEPENDENCY → LOCAL CONTROL" list instead.
- **New `app/work/halogrip/scroll-refresh.tsx`**, rendered once at the very end of `<main>` in
  `page.tsx`. Not a visual component (`return null`) — it exists because some sections
  (`scroll-intro.tsx`, `design-gap-scene.tsx`) defer their real pin-creating ScrollTrigger to a
  second, hydration-safe render pass, while others (`process-scene.tsx`, `overview-backdrop.tsx`)
  create theirs synchronously on first mount, against a document that's still the short, unpinned
  fallback layout — so their start/end pixel positions can get baked in against the wrong page
  height. `ScrollRefresh` calls `ScrollTrigger.refresh()` after two `requestAnimationFrame`s (past
  the enhanced-state-flip re-render cascade), again once `document.fonts.ready` resolves, and again
  on `window.load`, so every ScrollTrigger on the page ends up anchored to the final layout.
- **Flagging, not fixing**: `scroll-refresh.tsx` has a `// TEMP-DIAGNOSTIC: expose for console
  inspection, remove before finishing.` comment directly above `(window as any).__ST = ScrollTrigger;
  (window as any).__gsap = gsap;` — by its own comment this should have been removed already and
  wasn't. Left as-is since removing it wasn't requested; flag to Sylvia before shipping.
- `process-scene.tsx` (02.3) also picked up minor spacing/sizing tweaks outside this session
  (tighter `.process-node` cards, smaller intro-copy type scale, `.process-intro` no longer carries
  the `shell` class) — noted for completeness, not re-verified in depth here.

### Scroll-intro: stopped showing the old static hero as the 3D scene's loading placeholder (this session)
- Sylvia reported a flash of "the old intro" before the 3D model appears on `/work/halogrip`.
  Root cause: `scroll-intro.tsx`'s `HeroFallback` (the pre-3D-redesign hero — headline + metadata
  grid + full-bleed product photo — explicitly commented `"The original static hero, verbatim.
  Also used as the loading state of the 3D path."`) was being rendered a *second* time as an
  opaque full-screen overlay (`.scroll-intro-preload`, z-index 6) while the 3D scene's GLB model
  fetched/parsed/baked its environment, only crossfading out once `ready`. So every load, capable
  browsers genuinely saw the old design twice — once as the pre-hydration first paint (correct,
  unavoidable, SSR-hydration-safe), then again as a held loading placeholder for a variable
  (sometimes long) duration — before landing on the sparse 3D resting pose (ghost wordmark only,
  product parked off-screen). Not a misperception; the old hero really was flashing.
- Fix (scroll-intro.tsx lines 534-538): the `.scroll-intro-preload` overlay no longer renders
  `<HeroFallback />` as a child — it's now an empty `aria-hidden` div that relies on its own
  existing CSS background (`var(--paper-light)`) to show a blank screen during the load window,
  then crossfades into the 3D scene exactly as before (no timing/opacity/CSS changes). The *real*
  fallback — permanently shown to visitors with no WebGL, `prefers-reduced-motion`, or a
  narrow/mobile viewport (`canEnhance()`, scroll-intro.tsx:184-196) — is untouched: `HeroFallback`
  is still used, unchanged, at the top-level `if (!enhanced) return <HeroFallback
  titleId="project-title" />` branch (line 447), confirmed by grep to be the only remaining call
  site. Explicitly confirmed with Sylvia this fallback role must stay exactly as-is.
- Side benefit: also removes a redundant second fetch/mount of `hero.webp` (the preload's old
  `HeroFallback` was re-rendering the same `fetchPriority="high"` image the real fallback had
  already fetched once on first paint).
- Verified via `npm run build` (clean) and a dev-server screenshot sequence: immediately after
  navigation the screen is blank paper background (`.scroll-intro-preload`'s `innerHTML` confirmed
  empty via devtools), then crossfades cleanly into the 3D scene's ghost-wordmark resting state
  with the old hero never reappearing.

### 02.1 CABIN SHIFT rebuilt to match Sylvia's reference story-prototype mockup, then bridge line removed (this session)
- Fills half of the documentation gap the "Fixed site-wide broken images..." entry below flags
  ("02.1 CABIN SHIFT ... subsequently rebuilt ... structure not fully re-documented here yet";
  the other half, 02.2, is now covered by the entry directly above this one). Sylvia supplied a
  standalone reference mockup at `public/media/section 2 reference/index.html` + `styles.css` (a
  self-contained HTML/CSS "story prototype" not built by this session — its own `README.txt` says
  to port its section structure/copy into the real React page) and asked for 02.1 specifically to
  be recreated to match its `#shift` section, using the real cabin photo at
  `public/media/halogrip图片/2.1/robotaxi-cabin.png`.
- The reference's `#shift` section is a two-column grid: copy on the left, a `<figure>` on the
  right holding the cabin photo with a `figcaption` overlay of two "signal" rows (a red `+` for
  "More flexible passenger space", a grey `−` for "Traditional controls removed"), plus a
  right-aligned "bridge line" strip under the whole section ("The driver may disappear. The need
  to intervene does not.").
- Rebuilt `page.tsx`'s 02.1 section to match: replaced the old single-column
  `PlaceholderImage`-based scaffolding (described in the "THE CHALLENGE (02) split..." entry
  further below) with a new `.cabin-shift-layout` grid (`.challenge-scene-copy` +
  `<figure className="cabin-figure">` with the real photo + figcaption signal rows). Image is
  sourced directly from `/media/halogrip图片/2.1/robotaxi-cabin.png` via `encodeURI(...)` —
  matching the non-ASCII-path convention 02.2's `need-scene` background already established —
  rather than copying the file into a flat `public/media/` location.
- New CSS in `halogrip.css`: `.cabin-shift-layout`, `.cabin-figure` (+ `figcaption`, `.signal`,
  `.signal-plus`, `.signal-minus`), restyled with HALOGRIP's own established tokens (`--red
  #c93731`, `--dark`, `--white`, Nimbus Sans Narrow / DejaVu mono) instead of the reference
  mockup's own separate palette (`--red:#df4435`, `--blue:#0c78b8`) — per Hard Rule 1, the
  reference's layout was ported but not its visual identity. Mobile override added to the
  existing single `@media(max-width:760px)` block.
- The bridge-line strip was ported first (own `.bridge-line`/`.bridge-line span` CSS, right-aligned
  under a `shell`-classed `<p>`), then Sylvia asked to remove it — the paragraph and both CSS
  rules (desktop + the mobile-breakpoint override) were deleted outright, not just hidden.
- Verified via `npm run build` (clean) and a dev-server screenshot at `#challenge-cabin-title`:
  two-column layout, real cabin photo, and the plus/minus signal callouts render correctly; the
  section transitions cleanly into 02.2 with the bridge line gone.
- Not touched: 02.3/02.4's current state wasn't reverified in this session.

### 02.2 REAL-WORLD NEED rebuilt as a bespoke cinematic scene matching a supplied reference (this session)
- Replaced the placeholder `.challenge-scene challenge-scene-need` skeleton (eyebrow → heading/body
  copy → one `PlaceholderImage`) with a fully bespoke, full-bleed section (`.need-scene` in
  `page.tsx`/`halogrip.css`) built to match two assets Sylvia supplied directly: a background photo
  and a finished visual-target reference, both at `public/media/halogrip图片/2.2/2.2 background.png`
  / `2.2 reference.png` (1672×941, exactly 16:9). Only the background photo is ever rendered on the
  page — the reference image is a design target, not an asset — and the section's body-copy
  paragraph from the old skeleton was dropped entirely since the reference has no equivalent block.
- `.need-scene` is `position:relative;aspect-ratio:1672/941` with the photo as a `background-size:
  cover` layer (`.need-bg`) plus a top/bottom gradient scrim for text legibility. Everything else —
  eyebrow, headline, the three numbered leader-line annotations (`01 BLOCKED ROADS` / `02 BLOCKED
  FIRE STATION EXITS` / `03 DISRUPTED FIREFIGHTING`), the glowing dashed red route line, the red
  technical frame + corner brackets around the stalled car, the giant "74" stat, the stat caption,
  the "RESPONSE ORIGIN / FIRE STATION 12" bracket block, and the bottom source note — is positioned
  with `left/top` percentages (or, for the route/leader-lines/frame, one `<svg viewBox="0 0 1672
  941" preserveAspectRatio="none">` overlay) computed directly from pixel coordinates read off the
  reference image, so every element's position is proportional to the same 1672×941 grid the photo
  itself is on.
- This is why the section scales responsively without a mobile media-query rewrite (unlike every
  other stacked section in this file, which gets bespoke `@media(max-width:760px)` overrides): the
  container keeps its aspect ratio at any width, and since virtually all sizing is `vw`-relative
  (wrapped in `clamp()` with a legibility floor for narrow screens and a ceiling for very wide ones,
  same pattern as the rest of the file's `clamp()` usage) percentages and `vw` values stay accurate
  to the same composition at any viewport width — "responsive" here means "the same poster scaled
  down," not "content reflows."
- The existing global `.close-project` pill (fixed top-right, already rendered on every route) is
  what supplies the reference's top-right `CLOSE PROJECT` control — no second one was added for
  this section.
- Verified with `npm run build` and `npx tsc --noEmit` (both clean) and side-by-side dev-server
  screenshots against `2.2 reference.png`: eyebrow/headline position and size, route path shape,
  annotation/leader-line placement, frame+"74" placement, and the bottom-left bracket/source-note
  blocks all match closely. Full-width in-browser resize testing wasn't possible this session (see
  the tooling-limitation note in the "THE CHALLENGE (02) split..." entry below — window resize
  doesn't reliably change the automated browser's actual viewport here); responsiveness was instead
  verified by reasoning through the `vw`/`clamp()`/percentage math above rather than a real
  narrow-viewport screenshot.
- `// TODO(sylvia)` carried forward on the "74" stat and the bottom source line (`01 — SOURCE
  PENDING VERIFICATION.`) — the reference bakes the pending-verification caveat into the design
  itself as in-scene text, so it's flagged in both the JSX comment and literally on the page.

### Fixed site-wide broken images after a `public/media/` reorg (this session)
- `public/media/`'s flat image files (`hero.webp`, `emergency.webp`, `product-*.webp`,
  `story-*.webp`, `id-one/two.webp`, `hud.webp`, `sketches.webp`, `prototype.webp`,
  `night-city.webp`, `concept-*.webp`, `Bild1.png`, etc.) were moved into a new
  `public/media/halogrip图片/other/` folder (with `2.1`/`2.2`/`2.3`/`2.4` subfolders holding new
  bespoke assets for the CABIN SHIFT / REAL WORLD NEED work below) outside this session — by the
  time this session picked up, `page.tsx`'s two newest sections (02.1 CABIN SHIFT, 02.2 REAL
  WORLD NEED) already correctly pointed at the new `halogrip图片/...` paths, but every other
  image reference across the page (`overview-backdrop.tsx`'s background photo, the research
  gallery, design-principles product shot, concept-exploration sketches/grid, prototype-testing
  photo, final-hero background, product-detail shot, `interaction-deck.tsx`'s control image, the
  emergency-handover story grid + ID/HUD images, `scroll-intro.tsx`'s hero image, and the page's
  OpenGraph/Twitter metadata images) still pointed at the old flat `/media/*.webp` paths, which no
  longer resolve — this is what made the OVERVIEW background photo (and effectively every other
  image on the page) disappear.
- Fixed by repointing every stale reference to `/media/halogrip图片/other/<file>`, each wrapped in
  `encodeURI(...)` (matching the convention the two newer sections already used for the non-ASCII
  folder name — plain unencoded template-literal paths with non-ASCII segments are the kind of
  thing that can silently 404 depending on how the string reaches the browser). Verified every
  referenced filename actually exists under the new path (`ls`/`find`), `npm run build` stayed
  clean, and confirmed in-browser that the OVERVIEW photo and other previously-broken images
  render again.
- Note for future sessions: `scroll-intro-scene.tsx`'s `/media/image2.png` mention is just a code
  comment referencing a path *inside* the source `.pptx` zip (`ppt/media/image2.png`), not a real
  asset reference — left alone, not part of this bug.
- Also note: the "THE CHALLENGE split into 4 placeholder subsections" entry directly below this
  one (from earlier in this session) is now partly superseded — 02.1 CABIN SHIFT and 02.2 REAL
  WORLD NEED were subsequently rebuilt with real bespoke layouts/imagery/copy (outside this
  session's own edits, structure not fully re-documented here yet); 02.3 CURRENT SOLUTION and
  02.4 DESIGN GAP were still the plain `PlaceholderImage` scaffolding described below as of this
  writing.

### THE CHALLENGE (02) split into 4 placeholder subsections: CABIN SHIFT / REAL WORLD NEED / CURRENT SOLUTION / DESIGN GAP (this session)
- Replaced the single `.challenge` hero section (full-bleed `emergency.webp` background, REMOTE
  HELP / PUSH-TOW / NO OVERRIDE three-reasons grid) with 4 stacked sibling sections — `[ 02.1 /
  CABIN SHIFT ]`, `[ 02.2 / REAL WORLD NEED ]`, `[ 02.3 / CURRENT SOLUTION ]`, `[ 02.4 / DESIGN
  GAP ]` — at Sylvia's request, as placeholder scaffolding only; she'll give real content/design
  direction for each in a future session.
- Deliberately lightweight: everything is plain inline JSX in `page.tsx` (no new component
  files, no GSAP/ScrollTrigger, no custom SVG, no reveal-on-scroll animation) — this project's
  history shows these exact scenes (`real-world-scene.tsx`, `response-scene.tsx`,
  `design-gap-scene.tsx` from the reverted `60bad72`/"26082602" checkpoint) got fully rewritten
  from scratch once real direction arrived, so there was no benefit to building bespoke structure
  now. Each of the 4 sections shares one skeleton: eyebrow → heading+body copy → one
  `PlaceholderImage` (`app/components/PlaceholderImage.tsx`, imported via
  `../../components/PlaceholderImage`).
- Copy is a draft carried over from the reverted `60bad72` version's wording (per Sylvia's
  choice), not freshly invented — every heading/body block has its own
  `{/* TODO(sylvia): draft copy carried over from an earlier revision (commit 60bad72) —
  review/replace headline + body */}` comment, and every `PlaceholderImage` has its own
  `{/* TODO(sylvia): replace with a real ... */}` comment above it (per Hard Rule 5). The old
  "CURRENT RESPONSE" label is now "CURRENT SOLUTION" per Sylvia's explicit renaming — its copy
  still covers the same call/verify/authorize-or-dispatch/move-or-tow process, just relabeled.
  02.2's "74 AV-related disruptions" stat carried its existing `TODO(sylvia): verify and cite the
  source` flag forward.
- CSS: removed all 8 old `.challenge*` rules from `halogrip.css` and added a shared
  `.challenge-scene` base (padding-block + a `border-top` seam between subsections, sized to
  match `.principles`/`.journey`'s stacked-section rhythm) plus `.challenge-scene-inner`/
  `-copy`/`-image`. The 4 per-section modifier classes (`.challenge-scene-cabin`, `-need`,
  `-solution`, `-gap`) are wired into the JSX as hooks but intentionally carry no CSS of their
  own yet — no per-section tweaks were invented ahead of real design direction. Updated the
  shared display-font selector (`.hero-heading h1,.section h2,...`) to point at `.challenge-scene
  h2` instead of the removed `.challenge h2`. Mobile override (the file's one
  `@media(max-width:760px)` block) updated in place to match the new classes.
- Verified via `npm run build` (clean) and dev-server screenshots scrolling through all 4
  sections into `#research` (no overlap, seams render correctly); the mobile CSS rule was
  sanity-checked by injecting the new mobile-breakpoint rules as a scratch `!important` override
  at the current ~1536px automation viewport (confirms the `PlaceholderImage` aspect-ratio
  actually switches to `1.4/1` etc.) rather than a real narrow-viewport resize, then removed —
  same technique other sessions in this file have used for the same tooling limitation.

### Git history: reverted to the 26082601 snapshot, then re-applied just the OVERVIEW change (this session)
- The working tree had drifted through several dated checkpoint commits (`26082601` →
  `26082602` → `26082603` → two follow-up commits literally titled "破了，得重新做"/"垃圾" —
  "broken, redo"/"garbage" — indicating that work regressed). At Sylvia's request the tree was
  restored to match the `26082601` commit's content, twice (`git rm -rf .` +
  `git checkout <commit> -- .` + a new commit, not `reset --hard`, so full history stays intact
  and nothing was force-pushed). In between she asked to check `26082602` specifically to see
  whether THE CHALLENGE (02) had already been split into subsections there (it had — 4 files:
  `challenge-chapter.tsx`, `design-gap-scene.tsx`, `real-world-scene.tsx`, `response-scene.tsx`)
  before deciding to land on `26082601` instead, which predates that split entirely.
- Net effect: this file, `app/work/halogrip/page.tsx`, and `app/work/halogrip/halogrip.css` are
  currently at the `26082601` shape (THE CHALLENGE is still the old single `.challenge` section
  with the REMOTE HELP / PUSH-TOW / NO OVERRIDE three-reasons grid — **not** the 5-scene
  `ChallengeChapter` described in older revisions of this file's history). If a future session
  finds this file's "Structure reference" not mentioning `challenge-chapter.tsx` etc., that's why
  — it's not a documentation gap, the files really aren't here right now.
- With the tree at `26082601`, Sylvia asked for just the OVERVIEW (section 01) content/layout
  edit that `26082602` had introduced — without pulling back the THE CHALLENGE split — so it was
  re-applied by hand on top of the reverted tree (not by re-merging `26082602`):
  headline changed to "WHEN THE VEHICLE STOPS,<br/>THE RESPONSE SHOULD NOT.", body copy collapsed
  to one line ("HALOGRIP is a compact, low-speed fallback interface that lets authorized first
  responders reposition a stalled robotaxi on site."), and the `<figure className="city-banner">`
  (city photo + "74 AV-related disruptions" `stat-panel` figcaption) was deleted outright — same
  content edit `26082602` made, same reasoning: the "74" stat wasn't otherwise used anywhere in
  this `26082601`-based tree, unlike in `26082602` where it had already moved into
  `real-world-scene.tsx`'s 02.2 scene. `.overview` went from a 2-column grid to
  `display:grid;place-items:center;text-align:center`; `.city-banner`/`.stat-panel*` rules were
  deleted from `halogrip.css` as dead CSS.
- Follow-up bug found by Sylvia after that edit: the OVERVIEW background photo
  (`overview-backdrop.tsx`'s `.overview-bg`, `position:absolute;inset:0`) was rendering narrow —
  capped to `.shell`'s `width:min(100%,1700px)` instead of full-bleed — because `shell` was on
  the outer `<section className="overview section shell">` itself, so the absolutely-positioned
  background's containing block was that already-narrowed section. Fixed by moving `shell` off
  the outer section onto a new inner `<div className="overview-content shell">` wrapping just the
  eyebrow marker + copy (mirrors how `.challenge`/`.challenge-content` already split
  background-vs-content this exact way): outer section keeps `overview section` only, background
  is now full-bleed to the viewport, content stays constrained/centered inside the new wrapper.
  Added `overflow:hidden` to `.overview` to match `.challenge`'s pattern.
- Second follow-up: `.overview{min-height:850px}` didn't fill the viewport on the reviewer's
  actual screen (a 2560×1271 display — 850px left visible empty space above/below). Changed to
  `min-height:100vh` so the section is full-screen the moment it's scrolled into view, matching
  Sylvia's ask ("看到overview的时候是满屏"). The `max-width:760px` mobile override
  (`.overview{min-height:auto;padding-block:90px}`) was left untouched — not requested, and mobile
  intentionally sizes to content there rather than forcing full-screen.
- Verified via `npm run build` (clean each step) and dev-server screenshots at `#overview`'s live
  scroll position (same "layout can shift mid-scroll" caveat as other sessions in this file — this
  page's pinned `ScrollIntro` GSAP timeline affects document height while scrolling).

### Multi-project restructure (earlier session)
- Moved the entire former `app/page.tsx` (the HALOGRIP case study) to `app/work/halogrip/page.tsx`
  unchanged, with its CSS split out into `app/work/halogrip/halogrip.css` and its
  `interaction-deck.tsx` moved alongside it.
- Trimmed `app/globals.css` down to a shared Tailwind setup + `@theme` design tokens for the new
  homepage.
- Built a new `app/page.tsx` homepage cloned from Sylvia's Framer site
  (https://sylviaxie.framer.website/), using Tailwind utility classes throughout, with 1 real
  project card (HALOGRIP) + 3 "coming soon" placeholder cards.
- Added `next/font/google` (Inter Tight, Inter, DM Mono) to `app/layout.tsx` and split metadata
  so the root layout is generic and HALOGRIP's specific metadata lives on its own page.
- Fixed a cascade-layer bug where an unlayered `a{color:inherit}` reset was overriding Tailwind
  utility text colors (see Hard Rule 3 above).
- **Not yet done**: redeploying this to Vercel — the live site still shows the old single-page
  version as of this writing.

### Homepage real assets + animation pass (this session)
- Wired real images/logos into every homepage placeholder slot: header avatar, about-section
  portrait, all 4 logo-marquee marks (Cstrider/Volvo/Chalmers/Autoliv, recolored solid black,
  equal-size slots), and 3 of 4 project card covers (HALOGRIP, Maritime HMI Design, Truck Sensory
  Design, Maize Drying System). Source files moved from `public/mainpage picture/` into a clean
  `public/home/` structure (see that folder for the mapping); one file
  (`Namnlös design (1).jpg`) is still unused, left in place.
- Renamed all 4 project card titles to Sylvia's confirmed real names (`app/data/projects.ts`);
  the 3 non-HALOGRIP cards stay `comingSoon: true` / no `href` per Hard Rule 6, just with real
  photos and captions instead of gray placeholders.
- Compared homepage animations against the Framer reference and fixed mismatches:
  - `Hero.tsx`: added a letter-by-letter blur-in reveal for "Industrial Designer" (own `<style>`
    keyframe block, no `globals.css` change).
  - `SiteHeader.tsx`: fades in ~1.25s after the hero reveal finishes (was simultaneous before).
  - `LogoMarquee.tsx`: keeps its auto-scrolling marquee (confirmed with Sylvia this should stay,
    despite the reference itself appearing static when inspected).
  - New `ScrollZoomImage.tsx` (`"use client"`): wraps each project card cover in a scroll-linked
    zoom — scale ~1.0 when the card is vertically centered in the viewport, growing to ~1.22 near
    the top/bottom edges, measured directly off the reference site's own scroll behavior.
  - `ProjectCard.tsx`: subtitle is now hover-only (`group-hover:opacity-100`), and hovering
    reveals a full-width scrolling tag-pill ticker over the cover image (placeholder tags for now,
    `app/data/projects.ts`).
- `npm run build` failed at the time on a TypeScript error in
  `app/work/halogrip/scroll-intro-scene.tsx` (`OrthographicCamera.aspect`) from in-progress work
  on the HALOGRIP scroll-intro scene that this session didn't touch — since fixed (see the
  scroll-intro entry below); `npm run build` is clean again as of this writing. All homepage work
  above was verified via the dev server + browser inspection instead (computed styles,
  `getAnimations()`, console-error checks), not `npm run build`.

### Homepage polish pass — corrections after direct reference-site instrumentation (this session)
Several follow-up rounds, each fixing a specific mismatch found by measuring the live reference
site's DOM/computed styles rather than guessing:
- `ScrollZoomImage.tsx`: the scroll-linked zoom was rebuilt from a symmetric
  distance-from-viewport-center formula to an **entry-progress-from-the-bottom-edge-only**
  formula (`entryProgress = clamp01((viewportH - rect.top) / rect.height)`). The old version also
  re-zoomed as a card exited near the top edge; the reference only reacts to the bottom edge —
  confirmed by polling the reference's own `getBoundingClientRect()`/`matrix3d` during scroll.
- `ProjectCard.tsx`, three separate bugs/mismatches found and fixed:
  - The hover tag-ticker used `animation-play-state: paused/running` toggling, which does **not**
    reset a CSS animation's progress — every hover resumed from wherever it last stopped instead
    of starting at `translateX(0)`. Fixed by only attaching `group-hover:animate-[tag-ticker_...]`
    at all on hover (no animation in the default state), so it's always fresh. Ticker background
    also changed from a dark gradient to the reference's measured `#f4f4f6`.
  - The title/subtitle caption was a detached block below the image with a gap; the reference
    fuses it to the image's bottom edge as one rounded card. Rounding/clipping moved from
    `ScrollZoomImage`'s className up to the card's root element; the caption is now
    `absolute inset-x-0 bottom-0` with `bg-[#f4f4f6]`, growing its `max-height` on hover
    (bottom-anchored, so it visibly grows *upward* into the photo) to reveal the subtitle stacked
    below the title, rather than the title/subtitle sitting side-by-side.
  - Sizing iterated up in a few rounds per Sylvia's feedback: title is `text-xl` (was `text-lg`),
    ticker padding/text bumped to `px-6 py-5`/`text-sm` (was `px-4 py-2`/`text-[10px]`).
- `app/globals.css`: `--radius-card` reduced from `52px` to `20px` — matches the reference card's
  measured `border-radius` exactly (`getComputedStyle` on its outer `<a>`). Affects every
  `rounded-card` use (project cards, about-section portrait).
- `ContactSection.tsx`: added the "Contact" eyebrow pill above the heading (same pattern as
  About/Experience/Testimonials — was missing entirely). "Let's talk" button flipped from solid
  black/light-text to the reference's actual style: light pill (`bg-bg text-ink`, matching its
  measured `rgb(249,249,250)`/`rgb(20,20,21)`), bigger padding, plus a blurred orange-red radial
  glow (`rgba(255,77,46,...)`) sitting behind/under it, reproducing the reference's glow div.
  `SiteFooter.tsx` deliberately left alone — Sylvia confirmed the reference has no equivalent
  footer but wants to keep ours anyway.
- Added a **`CLOSE PROJECT` button** to `/work/halogrip` (`page.tsx` + `.close-project*` rules in
  `halogrip.css`) — Sylvia's request, not a reference-site match. `position: fixed` top-right,
  black pill/white text, stays visible through the whole scroll (verified past 1500px of scroll).
  Hover reveals a duplicate stacked copy of the label sliding up (`translateY(-38px)`, one
  line-height) to read as "selected." Hit one bug while building it: `align-items: center` on the
  outer pill centered the two-line text track inside the clipped window, showing the seam between
  both copies instead of one clean line — fixed with `align-items: flex-start`.

### HALOGRIP scroll-intro: ported 1:1 from PowerPoint reference (this session)
- The pinned scroll-driven 3D opening (`scroll-intro.tsx` / `scroll-intro-scene.tsx` /
  `scroll-intro.css`, R3F + `three` + GSAP `ScrollTrigger`, real product model at
  `public/models/halogrip.glb`) was rebuilt to match a reference animation Sylvia had already
  designed in PowerPoint (`public/media/Final Presention for claude12.pptx`, a real embedded 3D
  Model object + Morph transitions across 9 slides), rather than the text-brief guess a first
  pass had shipped. Ground truth (exact per-slide pitch/yaw/roll, on-screen frame, text, colors,
  font, and a custom directional-arrow shape) was extracted straight from the `.pptx`'s OOXML —
  it's a zip; `ppt/slides/slideN.xml`'s `<am3d:model3d>` element and `<p:xfrm>` have the numbers.
- Confirmed with Sylvia and implemented: accent color is `#2D5391` (`--accent` in
  `halogrip.css`, replacing an earlier invented `--navy`), font is **Poppins** via
  `next/font/google` scoped to this route only (not the page's usual Nimbus Sans Narrow — a
  deliberate, confirmed exception for just this section). The part-callout stage is one static
  text block (not per-part 3D-tracked labels), and the Forward/Brake/Reverse stage keeps the
  model's **3D** pose frozen at the side view (there is no separate Neutral state).
- The Forward/Brake/Reverse stage does rock the product, and that rock is not a 3D move: every
  one of slides 4-9 freezes `<am3d:rot>` at the side view, and what Morph actually animates is
  the `rot` attribute on each slide's `<p:graphicFrame>`'s `<p:xfrm>` — a flat, in-the-picture-
  plane turn of the whole rendered frame. Decoded (60000ths of a degree, clockwise, absent = 0)
  that is one continuous sweep, never doubling back: slide 4 = 0, slides 5-6 = +15.12, slides
  7-8 = 0, slide 9 = -22.79 (stored as 337.21). It rides on its own `SceneState.tilt` channel,
  deliberately not on `pitch` — `pitch` is the slide 1-4 approach and stays parked afterwards.
  The scene applies it to the `place` group, i.e. about the camera's own view axis, *outside*
  the pose rotation. Do not fold it into pitch/yaw/roll: at yaw -90 both of the other Euler
  channels have landed on world X, so composing there foreshortens the side view instead of
  rocking it (an earlier draft's bug). Note it disagrees in direction with
  `interaction-deck.tsx` further down the page, whose FORWARD is -16 (anticlockwise) against
  this stage's +15.12 (clockwise) for the same word — the deck's numbers are that component's
  own, the intro's come from the PPT; flagged for Sylvia, not reconciled.
- Camera is `OrthographicCamera`, not perspective — required so the model's on-screen size
  matches the deck's frame percentages exactly at every pose; a perspective camera measurably
  over-sized the side-view pose.
- Verified: `npm run build` and `npx tsc --noEmit` both clean; scroll sequence checked stage by
  stage against the deck's own rasterized per-pose renders (`ppt/media/image*.png` inside the
  pptx) since the paired screen-recording video wouldn't play back reliably in-browser; reversal
  (scroll to bottom then back to top) mirrors correctly; mobile/no-WebGL/reduced-motion fallback
  still renders the plain static hero.
- Slide 3's second copy of the model is now in (Sylvia confirmed she wants it). That slide layers
  two instances, so `scroll-intro-scene.tsx` renders two: the persistent one the whole timeline
  scrubs, and a stage-2-only backdrop that fades in and out on the callout block's exact beats
  (`SceneState.backdrop`, tweened at 0.30 and 0.40 alongside `calloutRef`). Per-instance notes:
  - The fit mechanism is the standalone `fitToFrame(place, rotate, pose, silhouette, lens,
    scratch, depth)` — it takes an instance's pose and frame as arguments, so the scrubbed
    `SceneState` and the backdrop's frozen `Pose` run through identical code.
  - Which slide-3 pose belongs to which instance was corrected once and is now confirmed: the
    persistent model takes the **left** pose (26.5/-50.4/-20.7, `POSE_CLOSE_UP`) and the backdrop
    the **right** one (43.1/29.8/24.6, `POSE_CLOSE_UP_BACKDROP`) — matching slide 3's own z-order,
    where the left copy is the later shape and therefore on top. This also makes the whole
    sequence turn 0 -> -50 -> -90 in one direction instead of doubling back.
  - `Object3D.clone()` shares material references (checked against this GLB: 21 meshes, 13
    materials, all shared), so the backdrop clones its own or fading it would fade the primary.
  - The backdrop's meshes get an explicit near-to-far `renderOrder`. Without it a translucent
    solid double-blends wherever the default back-to-front order applies, and the instance comes
    out visibly blotchy rather than uniformly faded.
- Nothing from this pass has been committed to git — changes are sitting in the working tree.

### HALOGRIP scroll-intro: pacing, arc, and lighting fixes (this session)
- **Pacing.** The PPT's own timing (unzip the pptx, `ppt/slides/slideN.xml`'s `<p:transition>`)
  is a consistent 1500ms Morph on every slide 2-9, plus a 2000ms hold (`advTm="2000"`) on slides
  1-3 before auto-advancing — roughly a 43:57 move:hold ratio. The first PPT-accurate pass didn't
  reproduce this: pose/opacity tweens spanned almost the entire width of each scroll stage,
  leaving near-zero dwell time, so elements (the callout block, the stage-2 backdrop instance)
  were still mid-fade when the next stage already started clearing them. Fixed by raising the pin
  distance from `+=550%` to `+=750%` (shrinking tween durations inside the same budget would just
  make the same distance mostly dead, not add real dwell time) and rebalancing every content stage
  to roughly that 43:57 ratio, with fades landing on the *same* beat as the pose/element they
  belong to rather than trailing it. New stage boundaries: S0 0-0.06, S1 0.06-0.19, S2 0.19-0.36,
  S3 0.36-0.50, S4 0.50-0.63, S5 0.63-0.79, S6 0.79-0.95, S7 0.95-1.0 (S5/S6 each now carry two
  beats, since they each cover two source slides).
- **Lighting / "buttons look black instead of silver."** Root cause: six of the GLB's thirteen
  materials ("纹理铝") are `metalness:1, roughness:0.1` — a pure metal has no diffuse term, so
  under point/directional lights alone it can only return a few specular pinpoints and otherwise
  reads as black. The missing input was an environment, not more lamps. Fixed in
  `scroll-intro-scene.tsx`: added a `StudioEnvironment` (three's built-in `RoomEnvironment`, no
  network fetch, baked once via `PMREMGenerator` into `scene.environment`), and replaced the
  placeholder lighting with the deck's own real rig, read straight out of `<am3d:model3d>`'s
  `<am3d:ambientLight>`/`<am3d:ptLight>` elements: ambient (.5,.5,.5 @ illuminance 0.5) plus a warm
  key / cool fill / violet rim point light at the PPT's own colors and a 9.77 : 12.25 : 3.13
  intensity ratio (positions used as normalized directions at a fixed radius, `decay={0}` so
  brightness doesn't shift when `fitToFrame` rescales the model). Verified side-by-side against
  the deck's own cached `ppt/media/slide2.png`-equivalent render.
- **Backdrop opacity.** Was capped at a deliberate 0.5 (invented, to keep the callout text
  legible over it) — but neither `<am3d:model3d>` shape in the deck has any alpha effect; the
  ground truth is fully opaque. Changed `BACKDROP_OPACITY` to 1. No legibility conflict in
  practice: the backdrop's frame bottoms out at 57% viewport height, the callout starts at 68.1%,
  they don't overlap.
- **Arc/arrowhead — two real bugs, not one.** (1) `ARC_PATH` had originally been built by treating
  the PPT arc preset's `adj1`/`adj2` as literal ellipse parametric angles; they're true geometric
  angles and the `arc` preset applies its own `atan2`-based conversion first — on a 500x143 box
  this put both path endpoints tens of px off and the end tangent ~30° out, which is what first
  showed up as a misaligned triangle. Recomputed from the real conversion (verified against
  PowerPoint's own exported slide images to sub-pixel accuracy). (2) After that fix, the triangle
  was still visibly wrong in a way that turned out to have nothing to do with the earlier flip
  (`scaleX(-1)`) suspicion — a controlled test proved the CSS mirror was rendering a faithful,
  undistorted mirror image both times. The actual cause: DrawingML shortens a line by the
  arrowhead's own length so the head sits neatly *on* the stroke's end; SVG `marker-end` does not
  — the stroke kept running full-length underneath the triangle, so its butt cap poked out past
  one flank (the "notch"), the arc's own curvature across that span misaimed the auto-oriented
  head (the "squashed diamond"), and the tip never actually cleared the line (it read as buried,
  not pointed). Fixed by cutting the stroke back to the head's base and replacing the
  `orient="auto"` `<marker>` with an explicitly-computed triangle polygon (tip position kept from
  the earlier fix; base/axis computed from the *chord* across the head — not the end tangent or
  base tangent, chord is what PowerPoint itself orients an arrowhead to; head size kept at 3x
  stroke width per the deck's own `<a:tailEnd type="triangle" w="med" len="med"/>`). Verified with
  tight zoomed screenshots on all three states (Forward/Brake/Reverse): clean triangular tip
  clearly proud of the line, no notch, symmetric barbs, in every state.
- Nothing from this pass has been committed to git either — still sitting in the working tree.
