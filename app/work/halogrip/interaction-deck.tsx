/**
 * `product-side.webp` is not shot upright — measured directly (pixel centroid of the wand's
 * long axis, sampled via `sharp`, rows clear of the base cylinder), the photo itself already
 * leans ~22deg clockwise. `rotate(0deg)` on it was therefore never upright — NEUTRAL_ANGLE
 * counter-rotates that measured baseline so the resting pose is genuinely upright.
 *
 * There is no standalone NEUTRAL card — Sylvia flagged it as confusing once BRAKE and NEUTRAL
 * rendered as the exact same upright pose (a 4th button whose click produced no visible change).
 * BRAKE's own copy already carries the "returns to neutral" idea, so it does that job: FORWARD
 * tilts forward off the upright rest position; BRAKE releases back to it (deceleration, not a
 * new pose — this is what used to be labelled NEUTRAL_ANGLE with no offset); REVERSE continues
 * past that same rest position in the opposite direction from FORWARD.
 *
 * FORWARD/REVERSE's *direction* (which way is clockwise vs counter-clockwise) previously wasn't
 * derived from anything — it was set by eyeballing this cropped, no-context studio photo, which
 * has no windshield/dashboard in frame to tell you which rotation is physically "forward." That
 * guess was wrong (confirmed live: forward read as tilting backward), and every earlier fix here
 * was the same kind of guess, so it kept landing wrong. This is now pinned to the one place in
 * this project that actually has an authoritative answer: `scroll-intro.tsx`'s
 * `TILT_FORWARD`/`TILT_BRAKE`/`TILT_REVERSE`, read directly from the real PowerPoint deck's own
 * frame-rotation values (not guessed — extracted from the `.pptx` XML) for this exact gesture.
 * Forward is clockwise off rest, reverse is counter-clockwise (-22.79deg) off rest, brake is
 * rest itself (0deg offset) — applied on top of NEUTRAL_ANGLE below.
 *
 * FORWARD's *magnitude* does deliberately depart from the PPT's own 15.12deg, though: Sylvia
 * flagged live that at that value forward read as too subtle — closer to what she pictured for
 * brake than for a clear forward push. First bumped to match REVERSE's own magnitude (22.79deg),
 * then bumped again per a further round of live feedback ("forward's angle, add a bit more") —
 * forward is now visibly the most tilted of the three, past REVERSE's magnitude.
 *
 * Brake now returns to the illustration's neutral pose, matching its instruction text.
