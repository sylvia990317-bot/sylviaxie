/**
 * 05 / CONCEPT EXPLORATION — a scattered "sketch deck": five overlapping paper sheets, one
 * large and sharp in the centre, the rest smaller/faded/rotated behind it. Switching which
 * sketch is centred happens ONLY via the left/right arrow buttons (or Left/Right arrow keys
 * while the deck has focus) — nothing here reads scroll position, wheel deltas, or drag.
 *
 * This is the third structural rebuild of this section (see CLAUDE.md's changelog): first a
 * scroll-scrubbed filmstrip, then a wheel/drag hero carousel, then a plain click-controlled
 * gallery (one image + 01-04/SELECTED pagination). This round replaces the gallery's single-
 * image-at-a-time layout with the overlapping-sheets treatment Sylvia mocked up directly
 * (`public/media/halogrip图片/other/skets reference.png`) and drops the pagination
 * boxes/SELECTED button entirely in favour of just the two arrows.
 *
 * Assets: back to the "Ideation - Concepts Exploration" sketches from ppt slides 11-15
 * (`public/media/halogrip图片/05/concept-*`) — Screen+External Device, Detachable/Modular
 * Steering Device, Touch Screen, HUD+Joystick, converging on the Pull-out Wheel as the
 * selected direction. An earlier round of this same rebuild switched to the *iteration*
 * sketches from slides 18-22 instead, extracted directly out of the pptx zip; Sylvia flagged
 * those as illegible ("草图都不对，全部都看不清晰为什么") even after repeated size increases —
 * the real problem wasn't card size, it was the source images themselves: white-on-black raw
 * scans with dense overlapping strokes and huge dead black margins around a small drawing, so
 * no amount of CSS scaling ever made them read better. The slides 11-15 set was already
 * sitting in the repo as clean, well-composed, black-on-white line art (this project's very
 * first "Concepts Exploration" round used it before later rounds drifted away from it) —
 * switching back to it is a strict legibility fix, not a new content direction.
 *
 * Slot layout: each non-active concept is assigned one of four fixed background positions
 * (upper-left / lower-left / upper-right / lower-right) by its position in CONCEPTS relative
 * to whichever is active, recomputed on every index change — so the four background sheets
 * visibly reshuffle into their new slots (or the centre) rather than jumping. GSAP drives the
 * per-card `xPercent`/`yPercent`/`rotation`/`scale`/`opacity` tween (percent-based so it's
 * self-relative to each card's own box, independent of the stage's actual measured size — no
 * ResizeObserver needed here, unlike earlier rounds of this component).

  // bottom edge, obscuring the intro line — "Four approaches explored... 这行小字现在被挡住了").
