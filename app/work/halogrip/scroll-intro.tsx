/**
 * Scroll-driven 3D product intro for the HALOGRIP case study.
 *
 * Every pose, frame, colour, font and text string below is lifted straight out of
 * Sylvia's own PowerPoint build of this animation
 * (`public/media/Final Presention for claude12.pptx`, 9 slides + Morph). A .pptx is a
 * zip of OOXML: each slide's `<am3d:model3d>` carries the 3D rotation, `<p:xfrm>` the
 * 2D frame, `<a:t>` the copy, and the `prst="arc"` shape the directional graphic.
 * Angles are stored in 60000ths of a degree, lengths in EMU (9144000 x 5143500 slide).
 *
 * Responsibilities kept here:
 *  - fallback detection (reduced motion / no WebGL / narrow viewport)
 *  - the GSAP + ScrollTrigger timeline (all scrub math and reversal)
 *  - the HTML overlay (ghost wordmark, fact labels, callout block, arc, stage titles)
 *
 * Three.js lives entirely in `./scroll-intro-scene`, loaded with `ssr:false` from
 * here (a Client Component) because that is invalid from a Server Component.
 *
 * Perf contract: the only React state that changes during the sequence is the discrete
 * 0-2 direction bucket. Everything continuous is written onto a plain mutable object
 * that a single `useFrame` reads, or straight onto DOM nodes by GSAP — zero re-renders
 * per scroll frame.

 * The arc: a stroked partial ring with a triangle only on its tail — the deck's
 * `prst="arc"` shape, whose ellipse is inscribed in the shape box (rx 500, ry 143.03 in
 * viewBox units) and swept between `adj1` 282.486deg and `adj2` 349.156deg. Stroke width
 * 40.2 viewBox units is the PPT's 10pt line (`<a:ln w="127000">`) at this shape width.
 *
 * The two adj angles are *true geometric angles*, not ellipse parameters, and on a box this
 * far from square (500 x 143, ratio 3.5) the difference is enormous. The preset says so
 * itself: `arc`'s geometry list converts the angle before handing it to `arcTo`, via
 *
 *     wt1 = wd2 sin(ang);  ht1 = hd2 cos(ang);  param = atan2(wt1, ht1)
 *
 * (the `cat2`/`sat2` formulas). Feeding the raw angles in as parameters — which is what an
 * earlier pass here did — moved both ends of the arc by ~50-60px at slide scale. Converted
 * properly, the full arc runs
 *
 *     start: true 282.486deg -> param -86.376deg -> (531.61, 0.29)
 *     end:   true 349.156deg -> param -33.807deg -> (915.46, 63.45)
 *     sweep: +52.57deg, so SVG large-arc-flag 0, sweep-flag 1
 *
 * on an ellipse centred (500, 143.03), and measures 391.06 units long.
 *
 * The tail triangle is `<a:tailEnd type="triangle" w="med" len="med"/>`. Both "med"s are 3x
 * the line width, so the head is 120.6 x 120.6 units against the 40.2 stroke — confirmed off
 * PowerPoint's own raster, where it measures 77.9 long by 77.3 wide against a 27.9 stroke.
 *
 * It is drawn as an explicit polygon rather than a `marker-end`, for two reasons, both of
 * which were live bugs here:
 *
 *  1. DrawingML *shortens the line by the arrowhead's length* so the head sits on the end of
 *     the stroke instead of on top of it. An SVG marker does not: the stroke still ran the
 *     full 391 units, so the last 120.6 of it stayed painted underneath the triangle and its
 *     butt cap squirted out past the head's lower flank. Because the arc turns 11deg across
 *     that span, the head's barbs also landed over a stretch of stroke pointing somewhere
 *     else — the two together read as a lopsided blob with a notch, not an arrow, and the tip
 *     never came clear of the line. The stroke below therefore stops at the head's base.
 *  2. `orient="auto"` takes the tangent at the vertex it is attached to, and Brake/Reverse
 *     mirror the whole `<svg>` with `scaleX: -1`. Pinning the geometry removes any question
 *     of how an auto-oriented marker composes with a negative-determinant transform: the
 *     mirrored states are now exactly the mirror image of the unflipped one.
 *
 * Head geometry, from the arc's own arc-length parameterisation:
 *   tip         = the arc's true end, (915.46, 63.45)
 *   base centre = 120.6 back along the arc, (800.01, 28.59)
 *   axis        = tip - base centre, 16.80deg — the chord across the head, which is what
 *                 PowerPoint orients an arrowhead to. The end tangent alone (23.05deg) cocks
 *                 the head off the line it is sitting on; the base tangent alone (12.17deg)
 *                 under-turns it.
 *   corners     = base centre +/- 60.3 along the axis normal
 * The stroke is cut 6 units short of the base (at 114.6 back) so it tucks under the triangle
 * rather than butting it exactly — the two edges are 4.6deg apart, so an exact join would
 * leave a hairline of background showing at one corner.
