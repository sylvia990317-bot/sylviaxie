/**
 * R3F internals for the HALOGRIP scroll intro.
 *
 * This file owns nothing but Three.js. All scroll math lives in `scroll-intro.tsx` and
 * arrives here through a single plain mutable object (`SceneState`) that a lone
 * `useFrame` reads every frame — no React state drives the continuous animation.
 *
 * The camera never moves. Each frame the model is rotated to the current pitch/yaw/roll,
 * rocked by the current `tilt` about the camera axis (the deck's own 2D turn of the rendered
 * frame across slides 4-9 — see `TILT_SIGN`),
 * and then *fitted* into the target on-screen rect, which is how PowerPoint treats an
 * embedded 3D model: the frame in the slide XML is the tight bounding box of the render,
 * so it changes aspect as the model turns (2.04 on slide 1, 0.61 on slide 4).
 *
 * Two instances of the model exist. The primary one is scrubbed across every slide; the
 * backdrop one is slide 3's second copy, a fixed pose that only fades in and out. Both go
 * through the same `fitToFrame` per frame — the fit depends on nothing but the pose, the
 * silhouette sample and the camera, so one function serves both.

 * the 3D model. Two things follow from that. First the sign: PowerPoint, like CSS, measures a
 * positive turn clockwise, while Three.js measures `rotation.z` counter-clockwise because +Z
 * points at the camera, so the value is negated here. Second the axis: the only rotation that
 * reproduces turning a flat render is one about the view axis, applied *outside* the pose
 * group — `place`, which the pose never touches.
 *
 * It deliberately is not composed onto pitch/yaw/roll. The pose holds yaw at -90 here, and
 * under the default XYZ Euler order both of the other channels have ended up pointing across
 * the screen: `pitch` is world X outright, and the yaw has carried `roll`'s local Z onto world
 * X too. Either one tips the product toward or away from the camera, which on a side view is
 * foreshortening — the silhouette squashing while the rim swings out — not a rock. That is the
 * trap an earlier draft of this stage fell into, and it is not what the deck does either.
 *
 * Doing it in the scene rather than as a CSS `transform: rotate()` on the canvas wrapper — the
 * other way to turn a finished render, and the closer analogue to PowerPoint — buys two things:
 * the turn is rasterised at full device resolution each frame instead of resampling an already
 * rendered bitmap, and it stays on `SceneState` with every other continuous channel in this

 * same reason the lights run at `decay={0}`: under physical inverse-square falloff the

 * is the rig's shape — the directions, the colours, and the 9.77 : 12.25 : 3.13 intensity
 * ratio — brought into three.js's range by one shared gain.
